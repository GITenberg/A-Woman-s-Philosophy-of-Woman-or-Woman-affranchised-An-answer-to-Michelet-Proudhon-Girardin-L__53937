</div>

<p>The general interest evinced in the theories of Michelet
and other philosophers concerning the functions and province
of woman, and the lively opposition to these theories
manifested in many quarters, have called forth an American
translation of the present work. This remarkable
book of Madame d'Héricourt on woman is conceded to be
the best reply to these philosophers extant. The work,
intended by the author as "a refutation of the coarse indecency
of Proudhon, and of the perfumed pruriency of
Michelet, and the other false friends and would-be champions
of woman," has had a remarkable history. Published
first at Brussels, it was interdicted in France, and notice
was given that all copies found would be seized.
Madame d'Héricourt appealed to the censorship to know
the reason of this interdiction, and was informed in reply
that the reason for such proceedings never was given.
Not content with this, she wrote to Napoleon III, enclosing
a copy of the work, and called his attention to the
fact that a book by a French author could be suppressed
in France without any reason being given for it, and
without any chance being offered to the author to clear
herself of the implied charge of immorality. Immediately
upon the reception of the letter, the Emperor withdrew
the interdiction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_VIII"> VIII</a></span>
Madame d'Héricourt is well known in France as an
able contributor to various philosophic journals, and also
as a member of the medical profession, in which she holds
a high and respected position. Her opinions are entitled
to great weight, and will be welcomed as throwing much
light on the practical question of the sphere of woman,
which is becoming one of increasing interest. The better
to adapt the book to the American public, it has been
slightly abbreviated in portions of local interest, referring
chiefly to French legislation. It has been well received
in England, as is testified by the following extract from
the <i>London Critic</i>, one of the ablest of the English
critical journals:</p>

<p class="blockquote">"The work is calculated to do an immense service to French
society at the present time&mdash;just when the literature of the
country is on the verge of decay from the rottenness which is
eating to its very core. 'La Femme Affranchie' points out
the remedy to the social cancer which has gnawed away the
vital principle of domestic life in France, and caused that antagonism
between the sexes which foreigners behold with the
most profound amazement. Madame d'Héricourt's bold and
nervous arguments completely destroy the brutal commonplaces
of Proudhon as regards the moral and intellectual capacity of
women. She takes him on his own ground, and to his medical
propositions returns medical objections of far greater weight
and power, being more competent to judge the question, as she
has passed examinations as 'Maitresse sage femme' of 'La
Clinique,' and received her diploma as medical practitioner many
years ago."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_IX"> IX</a></span></p>
<h2 class="normal">AUTHOR'S PREFACE.<br />
<span class="medium">TO MY READERS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Readers, male and female, I am about to tell you the end of
this book, and the motives which caused me to undertake it,
that you may not waste your time in reading it, if its contents
are not suited to your intellectual and moral temperament.</p>

<p>My end is to prove that woman has the same rights as man.</p>

<p>To claim, in consequence, her emancipation;</p>

<p>Lastly, to point out to the women who share my views, the
principal measures that they must take to obtain justice.</p>

<p>The word emancipation giving room for equivocation, let us
in the first place establish its meaning.</p>

<p>To emancipate woman is not to acknowledge her right to use
and abuse love; such an emancipation is only the slavery of
the passions; the use of the beauty and youth of woman by
man; the use of man by woman for his fortune or credit.</p>

<p>To emancipate woman is to acknowledge and declare her
free, the equal of man in the social and the moral law, and in
labor.</p>

<p>At present, over the whole surface of the globe, woman, in
certain respects, is not subjected to the same moral law as man;
her chastity is given over almost without restriction to the brutal
passions of the other sex, and she often endures alone the
consequences of a fault committed by both.</p>

<p>In marriage, woman is a serf.</p>

<p>In public instruction, she is sacrificed.</p>

<p>In labor, she is made inferior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_X"> X</a></span>
Civilly, she is <i>a</i> minor.</p>

<p>Politically, she has no existence.</p>

<p><i>She is the equal of man only when punishment and the
payment of taxes are in question.</i></p>

<p>I claim the rights of woman, because it is time to make the
nineteenth century ashamed of its culpable denial of justice to
half the human species;</p>

<p>Because the state of inferiority in which we are held corrupts
morals, dissolves society, deteriorates and enfeebles the race;</p>

<p>Because the progress of enlightenment, in which woman participates,
has transformed her in social power, and because this
new power produces evil in default of the good which it is not
permitted to do;</p>

<p>Because the time for according reforms has come, since women
are protesting against the order which oppresses them;
some by disdain of laws and prejudices; others by taking possession
of contested positions, and by organizing themselves
into societies to claim their share of human rights, as is done in
America;</p>

<p>Lastly, because it seems to me useful to reply, <i>no longer
with sentimentality</i>, but with vigor, to those men who, terrified
by the emancipating movement, call to their aid false science to
prove that woman is outside the pale of right; and carry indecorum
and the opposite of courage, even to insult, even to the
most revolting outrages.</p>

<p>Readers, male and female, several of the adversaries of the
cause which I defend, have carried the discussion into the
domain of science, and have not shrunk before the nudity
of biological laws and anatomical details. I praise them for
it; the body being respectable, there is no indecency in
speaking of the laws which govern it; but as it would be an
inconsistency on my part to believe that blamable in myself
which I approve in them, you will not be surprised that I follow
them on the ground which they have chosen, persuaded
that Science, the chaste daughter of Thought, can no more lose
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_XI"> XI</a></span>
her chastity under the pen of a pure woman than under that of
a pure man.</p>

<p>Readers, male and female, I have but one request to make;
namely, that you will pardon my simplicity of style. It would
have cost me too much pains to write in the approved fashion;
it is probable, besides, that I should not have succeeded. My
work is one of conscience. If I enlighten some, if I make
others reflect; if I awaken in the heart of men the sentiment of
justice, in that of women the sentiment of their dignity; if I
am clear to all, fully comprehended by all, useful to all, even
to my adversaries, it will satisfy me and will console me for
displeasing those who love ideas only as they love women: in
full dress.</p>

<p class="subh">TO MY ADVERSARIES.</p>

<p>Many among you, gentlemen, adversaries of the great and
holy cause which I defend, have cited me, evidently without
having read me, without even knowing how to write my name.
To such as these I have nothing to say, unless that their opinion
matters little to me. Others, who have taken the trouble to
read my preceding works in the <i>Revue Philosophique</i> and the
<i>Ragione</i>, accuse me of <i>not writing like a woman</i>, of being
harsh, unsparing to my adversaries, nothing but a <i>reasoning
machine, lacking heart</i>.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, I cannot write otherwise than as a woman, since
I have the honor to be a woman.</p>

<p>If am I harsh and unsparing to my adversaries, it is because
they appear to me to be those of reason and of justice; it is
because they, the strong and well armed, attack harshly and
unsparingly a sex which they have taken care to render timid
and to disarm; it is, in short, because I believe it perfectly
lawful to defend weakness against tyranny which has the
audacity and insolence to erect itself into right.</p>

<p>If I appear to you in the unattractive aspect of a <i>reasoning</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_XII"> XII</a></span>
<i>machine</i>, is, in the first place, because Nature has made me
so, and I see no good reason for modifying her work; secondly,
because it is not amiss for a woman that has attained majority
to prove to you that her sex, when not fearing your judgment,
reasons as well, and, often, better than you.</p>

<p>I have no heart, you say. I am lacking in it, perhaps, towards
tyrants, but the conflict that I undertake proves that I
am not lacking in it towards their victims; I have therefore
a sufficient quantity of it, the more, inasmuch as I neither desire
to please you, nor care to be loved by any among you.</p>

<p>Be advised by me, gentlemen; break yourselves of the habit
of confounding heart with nerves; cease to create an imaginary
type of woman to make it the standard of your judgment of
real women; it is thus that you pervert your reason and become,
without wishing it, the thing of all others the most hateful
and least estimable&mdash;tyrants.</p>

<p class="subh">TO MY FRIENDS.</p>

<p>Now to you, my friends, known and unknown, a few lines
of thanks.</p>

<p>You all comprehend that woman, as a human being, has the
right to develop herself, and to manifest, like man, her spontaneity;</p>

<p>That she has the right, like man, to employ her activity;
that she has the right, like man, to be respected in her dignity
and in the use which she sees fit to make of her free will.</p>

<p>That as half in the social order, a producer, a tax-payer,
amenable to the laws, she has the right to count as half in
society.</p>

<p>You all comprehend that it is in the enjoyment of these various
rights that her emancipation consists; not in the faculty of
making use of love outside a moral law based on justice and
self respect.</p>

<p>Thanks first to you, Ausonio Franchi, the representative of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_XIII"> XIII</a></span>
Critical Philosophy in Italy, a man as eminent for the profundity
of your ideas as for the impartiality and elevation of
your character; and who so generously and so long lent the
columns of your <i>Ragione</i> to my first labors.</p>

<p>Thanks to you, my beloved co-laborers of the <i>Revue Philosophique</i>
of Paris, Charles Lemonnier, Massol, Guepin, Brothier,
etc., who have not hesitated to bring to light the question
of the emancipation of my sex; who have welcomed the works
of a woman to your columns with so much impartiality, and
have on all occasions expressed for me interest and sympathy.</p>

<p>Thanks to you, in particular, my oldest friend, Charles Fauvety,
the indefatigable searcher after truth, whose elegant,
refined and limpid style is solely and constantly at the service
of progressive ideas and generous aspirations, as your rich
library and your counsels are at the service of those who are
seeking to enlighten humanity. Why, alas! do you join to so
many talents and noble qualities the fault of always remaining
in the background to give place to others!</p>

<p>Thanks to you, Charles Renouvier, the most learned representative
of Critical Philosophy in France, who join to such
profound doctrine, such acute perception and such sureness of
judgment; I would add, such modesty and unpretending virtue,
did I not know that it displeases you to bring you before
the public.</p>

<p>It is from your encouragement and approbation, my friends
and former co-laborers, that I have drawn the strength necessary
to the work I am undertaking; it is just, therefore, that I
should thank you in the presence of all.</p>

<p>It is equally just that I should publicly express my gratitude
to the Italian, English, Dutch, American and German journals
that have translated many of my articles; and to the men
and women of these different countries as well as of France,
who have kindly expressed sympathy for me, and encouraged
me in the struggle which I have undertaken against the adversaries
of the rights of my sex.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_XIV"> XIV</a></span>
To you all, my friends, both Frenchmen and foreigners, I
dedicate this work. May it be useful <i>everywhere</i> in the triumph
of the liberty of woman, and of the equality of all before
the law; this is the sole wish that a Frenchwoman can make
who believes in the unity of the human family, as well as in
the legitimacy of national autonomies, and who loves all nations,
since all are the organs of a single great body,&mdash;Humanity.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="medium">MICHELET.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Several women have sharply criticised Michelet's
"Love."</p>

<p>Why are intelligent women thus dissatisfied with so
upright a man as Michelet?</p>

<p>Because to him woman is a perpetual invalid, who
should be shut up in a gynæceum in company with a
dairy maid, as fit company only for chickens and turkeys.</p>

<p>Now we, women of the west, have the audacity to
contend that we are not invalids, and that we have a
holy horror of the harem and the gynæceum.</p>

<p>Woman, <i>according to Michelet</i>, is a being of a nature
opposite to that of man; a creature weak, <i>always
wounded, exceedingly barometrical</i>, and, consequently,
unfit for labor.</p>

<p>She is incapable of abstracting, of generalizing, of
comprehending conscientious labors. She does not like
to occupy herself with business, and she is destitute, in
part, of judicial sense. But, in return, she is revealed
all gentleness, all love, all grace, all devotion.</p>

<p><i>Created for man</i>, she is the altar of his heart, his refreshment,
his consolation. In her presence he gains
new vigor, becomes inspirited, draws the strength necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"> 18</a></span>
to the accomplishment of his high mission as worker,
creator, organizer.</p>

<p>He should love her, watch over her, maintain her;
be at once her father, her lover, her instructor, her priest,
her physician, her nurse, and her waiting-maid.</p>

<p>When, at eighteen, a virgin in reason, heart and body,
she is given to this husband, who should be twenty-eight,
neither more nor less, he confines her in the country in
a charming cottage, at a distance from her parents and
friends, with the rustic maid that we just mentioned.</p>

<p>Why this sequestration in the midst of the nineteenth
century, do you ask?</p>

<p>Because the husband can have no power over his wife
in society, and can have full power over her in solitude.
Now, it is necessary that he should have this full power
over her, since it belongs to him to form her heart, to
give her ideas, to sketch within her the incarnation of
himself. For know, readers, that woman is destined to
reflect her husband, more and more, until the last shade
of difference, namely, that which is maintained by the
separation of the sexes, shall be at last effaced by death,
and unity in love be thus effected.</p>

<p>At the end of half a score years of housekeeping, the
wife is permitted to cross the threshold of the gynæceum,
and to enter the world, or <i>the great Battle of
Life</i>. Here she will meet more than one danger; but
she will escape them all if she keeps the oath she has
taken <i>to make her husband her confessor</i>.... It
is evident that Michelet respects the rights of the soul.
The husband, who at this epoch has become absorbed
in his profession, has necessarily degenerated, hence
there is danger that the wife may love another; may
become enamored, for instance, of her young nephew.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"> 19</a></span>
In the book, she does not succumb, because she confesses
everything to her husband; still it may happen that she
succumbs, then repents, and solicits correction from her
lord and master. The latter should at first refuse, but,
if she insists, rather than drive her to despair, Michelet&mdash;who
would on no account drive a woman to despair&mdash;counsels
the husband to administer to his wife <i>the
chastisement that mothers infliction inflict on their darlings</i>.</p>

<p>There must be no separation between the husband
and wife; when the latter has given herself away, she
is no longer her own property. She becomes more and
more the incarnation of the man who has espoused her;
fecundation transforms her into him, so that the children
of the lover or of the second husband resemble the first
impregnator. The husband, being ten years older than
the wife, dies first; the woman must preserve her widowhood;
her rôle henceforth until death is to fructify within
her and about her the ideas which her husband has bequeathed,
to remain the center of his friendships, to
raise up to him posthumous disciples, and thus remain
his property until she rejoins him in death.</p>

<p>In case the husband survives, which may happen, the
author does not tell us whether he should re-marry.
Probably not, since love exists only between two; unless
Michelet, who reproves polygamy in this world, admits
it as morality in the life to come.</p>

<p>You see, my readers, that in Michelet's book, woman
is created for man; without him she would be nothing;
he it is who pronounces the <i>fiat lux</i> in her intellect; he
it is who makes her in his image, as God made man in
his own.</p>

<p>Accepting the Biblical Genesis, we women can appeal
from Adam to God; for it was not Adam, but God,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"> 20</a></span>
who created Eve. Admitting the Genesis of Michelet,
there is no pretext, no excuse for disobedience; woman
must be subordinate to man and must yield to him, for
she belongs to him as the work to the workman, as the
vessel to the potter.</p>

<p>The book of Michelet and the two studies of Proudhon
on woman, are but two forms of the same thought.
The sole difference that exists between these gentlemen
is, that the first is as sweet as honey, and the second as
bitter as wormwood.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I prefer the rude assailant to the poet;
for insults and blows rouse us to rebel and to clamor for
liberty, while compliments lull us to sleep and make us
weakly endure our chains.</p>

<p>It would be somewhat cruel to be harsh to Michelet,
who piques himself on love and poetry, and, consequently,
is thin skinned; we will therefore castigate him
only over the shoulders of M. Proudhon, who may be
cannonaded with red-hot shot; and we will content
ourselves with criticising in his book what is not found
in that of Proudhon.</p>

<p>The two chief pillars of the book on Love are,</p>

<p>First, that woman is a wounded, weak, barometrical,
constantly diseased being;</p>

<p>Second, that the woman belongs to the man who has
fructified and incarnated himself in her; a proposition
proved by the resemblance of the children of the wife
to the husband, whoever may be the father.</p>

<p>Michelet and his admirers and disciples do not dispute
that the only good method of proving the truth of a
principle, or the legitimateness of a generalization, is
<i>verification by facts</i>; neither do they dispute that to
make general rules of exceptions, to create imaginary
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"> 21</a></span>
laws, and to take these pretended laws for the basis of
argument, belongs only to the aberrations of the Middle
Age, profoundly disdained by men of earnest thought
and severe reason. Let us apply these data unsparingly
to the two principal affirmations of M. Michelet.</p>

<p>It is a principle in biology that <i>no physiological condition
is a morbid condition</i>; consequently, the monthly
crisis peculiar to woman is not a disease, but a normal
phenomenon, the derangement of which causes disturbance
in the general health. Woman, therefore, is not
an invalid because her sex is subject to a peculiar law.
Can it be said that woman is wounded because she is
subjected to a periodical fracture, the cicatrice of which
is almost imperceptible? By no means. It would be
absurd to call a man perpetually wounded who should
take a fancy to scratch the end of his finger every month.</p>

<p>Michelet is too well informed to render it necessary
for me to tell him that the normal hemorrhage does not
proceed from this wound of the ovary, about which he
makes so much ado, but from a congestion of the gestative
organ.</p>

<p>Are women ill on the recurrence of the law peculiar
to their sex?</p>

<p><i>Very exceptionally, yes</i>; but in the indolent classes,
in which transgressions in diet, the lack of an intelligent
physical education, and a thousand causes which I need
not point out here, render women valetudinarians.</p>

<p><i>Generally, no.</i> All our vigorous peasant women, our
robust laundresses, who stand the whole time with their
feet in water, our workwomen, our tradeswomen, our
teachers, our servant-maids, who attend with alacrity
to their business and pleasures, experience no uncomfortableness,
or at most, very little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"> 22</a></span>
Michelet, therefore, has not only erred in erecting a
physiological law into a morbid condition, but he has
also sinned against rational method by making general
rules of a few exceptions, and by proceeding from this
generalization, contradicted by the great majority of
facts, to construct a system of subjection.</p>

<p>If it is of the faculty of abstracting and generalizing
that Michelet, as he employs it, robs woman, we can
only congratulate her on the deprivation.</p>

<p>Not only is woman diseased, says Michelet, in consequence
of a biological law, but she is always diseased;
she has uterine affections, hereditary tendencies, which
may assume a terrible form in her sex, etc.</p>

<p>We would ask Michelet whether he considers his own
sex as always diseased because it is corroded by cancer,
disfigured by eruptions, tortured as much as ours by
hereditary tendencies; for hereditary tendencies torture
it as much as ours, and it is decimated and enfeebled
far more fearfully by shameful diseases, the fruits of its
excesses.</p>

<p>Of what, then, is Michelet thinking, in laying such
stress on the diseases of women in the face of the quite
as numerous diseases of men?</p>

<p>The wife should never be divorced or re-marry, because
she has become the property of the husband.
This is proved by the fact that the children of the lover
or of the second husband resemble the first husband.</p>

<p>If this is true, there are no children that resemble
their mother.</p>

<p>There are no children that resemble the progenitors
or collateral relatives of their parents.</p>

<p><i>Every child</i> resembles the first that knew his mother.</p>

<p>Can you explain, then, why it is that so often he does
<i>not</i> resemble him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"> 23</a></span>
Why he resembles a grandfather, an uncle, an aunt,
a brother, a sister of one of the parents?</p>

<p>Why, in certain cities in the south of France, the
inhabitants have preserved the Greek type, ascribed to
the women, instead of that of their barbaric fathers?</p>

<p>Why negresses who conceive from a white, bring into
the world a mulatto, oftenest with thick lips, a flat nose,
and woolly hair?</p>

<p>Why many children resemble portraits which had
attracted the attention of the mother?</p>

<p>Why, in fine, physiologists, impressed by numerous
facts, have thought themselves justified in declaring woman
<i>the preserver of the type</i>?</p>

<p>In the face of these undeniable facts, I ask you,
yourself, what becomes of your theory?</p>

<p>It returns to the domain of chimeras.</p>

<p>Some think that woman possesses a plastic force,
which makes her mould her fruit after the model which
love, hate, or fear has impressed within her brain; so
that the child thus becomes merely a sort of photograph
of a cerebral image of the mother.</p>

<p>By the aid of this theory, we might explain the resemblance
of the child to the father, to the first husband,
to beloved relatives or to friends, either living or
dead; but it would be impossible, thereby, to explain
how a woman can reproduce in her child the features
of a progenitor of her husband or of herself, whose portrait,
even, she has never seen; or how, in spite of
her wishes, the child resembles no one that she loves, etc.
Let us keep a discreet silence; the laws of generation
and of resemblance are unknown. If we succeed in discovering
them, it will be only by long and patient observation,
with the aid of judicious criticism, and an honorable
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"> 24</a></span>
determination to be impartial. Laws are not
created, but discovered; ignorance is more healthful for
the mind than error; to make general rules of <i>a few</i>
facts, without taking into account facts more numerous
by thousands which contradict them, is not to form a
science, but a system of poetical metaphysics; and these
metaphysics, however gracefully draped they may be,
are opposed to reason, to science, and to truth.</p>

<p>Michelet will pardon me this short lesson in method.
I should not presume to give it to him, were not men
repeating, like well-trained parrots, after him and Proudhon,
that woman is destitute of high intellectual faculties,
that she is unsuited to science, that she has no comprehension
of method, and other absurdities of like
weight.</p>

<p>Allegations such as these place women in a wholly
exceptional position, with respect to courtesy and reserve:
they owe no consideration to those who deny them these;
their most important business at the present time is to
prove to men that they deceive themselves, and that
they are deceived; that a woman is fully capable of
teaching the chief among them how a law is discovered,
how its reality is verified, how, and on what conditions
we have a right to believe, and to style ourselves, rational,
and rationalists.</p>

<p>Before concluding, let us dwell on a few passages of
the book on Love. I am curious to know what woman
Michelet addresses when he says:</p>

<p>"Spare me your elaborate discussions on the equality
of the sexes. Woman is not only our equal, but in
many points our superior. Sooner or later she will
know everything. The question to decide here is, whether
she should know all in her first season of love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"> 25</a></span>
Oh, how much she would lose by it! Youth,
freshness, poetry&mdash;does she wish, at the first blow, to
abandon all these? Is she in such haste to grow old?"</p>

<p>Pardon me, sir; you have already decreed that <i>there
are no longer any old women</i>; nothing, therefore, can
make woman grow old.</p>

<p>"There is knowledge of all kinds," you say; "likewise,
at all ages, the knowledge of woman should be
different from that of man. It is less science that she
needs, than the essence of science, and its living elixir."</p>

<p>What is this <i>essence</i>, and this <i>living elixir</i> of science?
Poetry aside, can you, in exact and definite terms, explain
to me what they mean?</p>

<p>Can you prove to me, a woman, that I desire to possess
knowledge differently from you?</p>

<p>Take care! disciple of liberty, you have not the right
to think and to wish in my place. I have, like you, an
intellect and a free will, to which you are bound, by
your principles, to pay sovereign respect. Now I forbid
you to speak for any woman; I forbid you in the
name of what you call <i>the rights of the soul</i>.</p>

<p>"You by no means deny," you say, "that, strictly
speaking, a young woman can read everything, and inform
herself of everything; can pass through all the
ordeals to which the mind of man is subjected, and still
remain pure. You only maintain," you add, "that her
soul, withered by reading, palled by novels, living habitually
on the stimulus of play-houses, on the aqua-fortis
of criminal courts, will become, not corrupted, perhaps,
but vulgar, common, trivial, like the curb-stone in
the street. This curb-stone is a good stone; you have
only to break it to see that it is white within. This
does not hinder it from being sadly soiled outside, in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"> 26</a></span>
every respect as dirty as the street gutter from which it
has been splashed.</p>

<p>"Is this, madam, the ideal to which you lay claim for
her who should remain the temple of man, the altar of
his heart, whence he daily rekindles the flame of pure
love?"</p>

<p>A truce to imagery and oratorical outbursts; none of
us demand for woman any degradation whatever. There
would be no need for us to demand what you censure,
since it is thoroughly authorized and practised. I by no
means wish to accuse you of bad faith, of want of reflection,
and of too much moral tolerance; yet let us
strip off your poetic mantle, and translate your thought
into prose; the drapery will no longer make us forget
the idea.</p>

<p>When instruction has been demanded for the people,
has any one ever taken it into his head to fancy that
the point in question was to make them read novels, to
swell the attendance on criminal courts, and to multiply
theatres?</p>

<p>No, you will say.</p>

<p>What authorizes you, then, to believe that those who
demand a solid education for woman, are seeking that of
of which you, on your part, do not dream for the people?</p>

<p>On the other hand, do you cultivate the intellect of
man by novels, theatres, and spectacles of criminal
courts? Is it in these things that his knowledge consists?
No, you will say. What is there, then, in common
between that which you censure, and the knowledge
that we desire for woman; and why attribute to
us absurd ideas, that you may have the pleasure of
wrangling with phantoms?</p>

<p>All your fine ladies are nurtured on novels, plays, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"> 27</a></span>
judicial excitements; yet they are neither vulgar, nor
trivial, nor comparable to curb-stones sullied by the mud
of the streets; what you tell them, therefore, is no
more true than kind.</p>

<p>But if you pay them doubtful compliments, which
they do not deserve, you absolve them too easily, in
turn. Listen to our principles, that you may not run
the risk of appearing unjust with respect to us.</p>

<p>Corruption in our eyes, is not merely the want of
chastity, or the shameful suit of gallantry, but all
habitual improper sentiment, all weakening of the moral
sense, and we absolutely condemn everything which
has power to lessen the sensibility of the soul, and to
turn it aside from the practice of justice, of virtue, and
of self-respect.</p>

<p>In consequence, we profess that the spectacles of
criminal courts habituate the heart to insensibility, and
should be avoided as much as executions.</p>

<p>We profess that the modern drama is generally evil,
because it excites interest for adulterers, robbers, seducers
and prostitutes; that the intellect is subjected in
theatres to an unhealthy and enervating atmosphere.</p>

<p>We profess, lastly, that novels should be read with
great moderation, because, in general, when they do not
corrupt the morals, they pervert the judgment and waste
precious time.</p>

<p>Though we love and esteem Art, we are indignant
at the bad use which is made of it, and we have little
esteem for those who avail themselves of it to lead the
heart astray, and to pervert the moral sense.</p>

<p>We say to woman: Educate yourselves, be worthy
and chaste; life is earnest, employ it earnestly.</p>

<p>You see that <i>woman in the image of the stained curb-stone</i>,
is by no means the ideal of which we dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"> 28</a></span>
Can you, a man of heart, can you treat women as
wretched and corrupt because they are willing no longer
to be slaves?</p>

<p>And besides, do you think that liberty, which in
man engenders individuality and virtue, would produce
in woman moral degradation?</p>

<p>Ah! leave these calumnies to those who have no
heart; they ill befit you, who may deceive yourself
through the lofty poetry of your soul, but who can
wish for evil only because you believe it to be good.</p>

<p>The women who ask to be free, great, mistaken poet,
are those who are conscious of their dignity, of the true
rôle of their sex in humanity; those who desire that
the women who follow them in the career of labor should
no longer be obliged <i>to live by man</i>, because to live by
him is at least to prostitute their dignity, and almost
always, their whole person. They wish that woman
should be the equal of man, in order to love him holily,
to devote herself without calculation, to cease to deceive
him or to rule him by artifice, and to become to him a
useful auxiliary, instead of a servant or a toy. They
know our influence over you; slaves, we can only debase
you; at present, we render you cowardly, selfish,
and dishonest; we send you out every morning, like
vultures, upon society, to provide for our foolish expenses
or to endow our children; we, women of emancipation,
are unwilling that our sex should longer play
this odious rôle, and be, through its slavery, an instrument
of demoralization and of social degradation,&mdash;and
this you impute to us as a crime!</p>

<p>Ah! I do not believe it; you yourself will say that
I ought not to believe it.</p>

<p>Looking from a deplorably narrow stand point, you
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"> 29</a></span>
fancied that you saw all woman-kind in a few valetudinarians,
your kind heart was moved for them, and you
sought to protect them. Had you looked far and high,
you would have seen the workers of thought and muscle;
you would have comprehended that inequality is to
them a source of corruption and suffering.</p>

<p>Then, in your lofty and glowing style, you would
have written, not this book of Love which repels all intelligent
and reflective women, but a great and beautiful
work to demand the right of half the human race.</p>

<p>The misfortune, the irreparable misfortune, is that instead
of climbing to the mountain top to look at every
moving thing under the vast horizon, you have shut
yourself up in a narrow valley, where, seeing nothing
but pale violets, you have concluded that every flower
must be also a pale violet; whilst Nature has created a
thousand other species, on the contrary, strong and vigorous,
with a right, like you, to earth, air, water and
sunshine.</p>

<p>Whatever may be your love, your kindness and your
good intentions towards woman, your book would be
immensely dangerous to the cause of her liberty, if men
were in a mood to relish your ethics: but they will remain
as they are; and the dignity of woman, kept waking
by their brutality, their despotism, their desertion,
their foul morals, will not be lulled to sleep under the
fresh, verdant, alluring and treacherously perfumed foliage
of this manchineel tree, called the book of <i>Love</i>.</p>

<p>In Michelet's later work, "Woman," by the side of
many beautiful pages full of heart and poetry are found
things that we regret to point out, for the sake of the
author.</p>

<p>M. Michelet has evidently amended, as we shall press
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"> 30</a></span>
on him; but as a spice of vengeance, he pretends that
their language has been dictated by directors, <i>philosophers
and others</i>. We know some of these ladies personally,
and can assure him that they have had no director
of any kind&mdash;quite the contrary.</p>

<p>Is it also in consequence of rancor that the author
pretends that woman loves man, not for his real
worth, but because he pleases her, and that she makes
God in her own image, "a God of partiality and caprice,
who saves those who please him?" "In feminine
theology," adds Michelet, "God would say: I love
thee because thou art a sinner, because thou hast no
merit; I have no reason to love thee, but it is sweet to
me to forgive."</p>

<p>Very well, your sex loves woman <i>for her real worth</i>;
we never hear a man, enamored of some unworthy
creature, say: "What matters it, I love her!" Your
love is always wise, and given reasonably; none but deserving
women can please you. I ask why so many
honest women are abandoned and unhappy, while so
many that are impure and vicious, yet sought and adored,
are in possession of the art of charming, of ruining
and of perverting men?</p>

<p>Michelet deplores the state of divorce which is established
between the sexes; we deplore it likewise; but
our complaints do not remedy it. Men shun marriage
from motives that do them no credit: they have at
their pleasure the poor girls whom want places at their
mercy; they shun marriage because they do not wish
a real, that is, an autonomous wife at their side; for
themselves, they wish liberty, for their wife, slavery.</p>

<p>On their side, women tend to enfranchisement, which
is well for them as it is for men: they should not suffer
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"> 31</a></span>
themselves to be turned aside from their pursuit; on the
other hand, as men are attracted by a costly toilette, and
neglect plainly dressed women, if the latter, in the wish
to please and retain them, imitate public women, whose
is the fault? Is it ours, who desire to please you and to
be loved by you, or yours, who can only be attracted by
dress? If you loved us <i>for our real worth</i>, and not because
our dresses and jewels please your eye, we would
not ruin you.</p>

<p>Let us point out in a few lines the contradictions and
differences that are found between Michelet's first and
second works.</p>

<p>In both, woman is the flame of love and of the fireside
religion, harmony, poetry, the guardian of the domestic
hearth, a housewife whose cares are ennobled by
love: civilization is due to her grace, she should be the
representative of grace if not of beauty.</p>

<p>In both books, the household must be isolated; the
wife must have no intimate friendship; mother, brothers
and sisters prevent her from becoming absorbed as
she ought to be in her husband. What we think of this
absorption is already known; we will only say here that
if the friends and relatives of the wife should be expelled,
those of the husband should be none the less so; the
mother and friends of the husband have more power to
injure the wife than those of the wife to injure the husband;
numerous sad facts prove this.</p>

<p>In "Love," woman is a receptive power, incapable
of comprehending conscientious works; she must receive
everything from her husband in the intellectual and
moral point of view.</p>

<p>In "Woman," she is half of the couple, in the same
ratio as man is capable of the most lofty speculations,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"> 32</a></span>
and thoroughly understands administration. She gives
the child the education that before all else will influence
the rest of his life. "So long as woman is not the
partner of labor and of <i>action</i>," says the author, "we
are serfs, we can do nothing&mdash;she may even be the
equal of man in medical science; she is a school, she
is sole educatress, etc."</p>

<p>Very well, thus far; and doubtless Michelet would
have been consistent, had he not got into his head a
masculine and a feminine ideal which spoils everything;
he reasoned to himself: "Man is a creator, woman a
harmony whose end and destination is love;" and, consequently,
he marks out for the latter a plan of education
different from that by which man should be developed;
the natural sciences are suited to woman, history should
only be taught her to form in her a firm moral and religious
faith. As love is her vocation, to each season of
the life of woman should correspond an object of love;
flowers, the doll, poor children, next the lover, then the
husband and children, then the care of young orphans,
prisoners, etc.</p>

<p>In "Love," the wife alone seems bound to confess to
the husband. In "Woman," the obligation is mutual.</p>

<p>The widow, in "Love," should not marry again, in
"Woman," she may espouse a friend of the husband, or
still better, the one whom he may choose on his deathbed;
if she is too old, she may watch over a young
man; but she will do better to protect young girls, to
make peace in families, to facilitate marriages, to superintend
prisons, etc.</p>

<p>We will carry the analysis no further; our objections
to the author's doctrine will be found in the article on
Proudhon, and in the sequel of the work.</p>

<h2 class="normal">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="medium">PROUDHON.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The tenth and eleventh studies of the last work of
M. Proudhon, "Justice in the Revolution and in the
Church," comprise the author's whole doctrine concerning
Woman, Love, and Marriage.</p>

<p>Before analyzing it and criticising its chief points, I
must acquaint my readers with the polemical commencement
which <i>appears</i> to have given rise to the publication
of the strange doctrines of our great critic. In the
<i>Revue Philosophique</i> of December, 1856, the following
article by me was published under the title, <i>Proudhon
and the Woman Question</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Women have a weakness for soldiers, it is said. It is
true, but they should not be reproached for it; they love
even the show of courage, which is a glorious and holy
thing. I am a woman, Proudhon is a great soldier of
thought. I cannot therefore prevent myself from regarding
him with esteem and sympathy; sentiments to
which he will owe the moderation of my attack on his
opinions concerning the rôle of woman in humanity.
In his first "Memoir on Property," note on page 265,
edition of 1841, we read the following paradox in the
style of the Koran:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"> 34</a></span>
"Between man and woman may exist love, passion,
the bond of habit, whatever you like; there is not <i>true
society</i>. <i>Man and woman are not companions.</i> The
difference of sex gives rise between them to a separation
<i>of the same nature as that which the difference of races
places between animals</i>. Thus, far from applauding
what is now called the emancipation of woman, I should
be much more inclined, were it necessary to go to this
extremity, <i>to put woman in seclusion</i>."</p>

<p>In the third "Memoir on Property," we read:</p>

<p>"This signifies that woman, <i>by nature and by destination</i>,
is neither <i>associate, nor citizen, nor public functionary</i>."</p>

<p>I open the "Creation of Order in Humanity," and
read there:</p>

<p>"It is in treating of education that we must determine
the part of woman in society. Woman, until she
becomes a wife, is <i>apprentice</i>, at most <i>under-superintendent</i>,
in the work-shop, as in the family, she <i>remains a
minor, and does not form a part of the commonwealth</i>.
Woman is not, as is commonly affirmed, <i>the half nor the
equal of man</i>, but the living and sympathetic <i>complement</i>
that is lacking to make him an individual."</p>

<p>In the "Economical Contradictions," we read:</p>

<p>"For my part, the more I reflect on the destiny of
woman outside of the family and the household, the less
I can account for it: <i>courtesan or housewife</i>, (housewife,
I say, not servant,) I see no medium."</p>

<p>I had always laughed at these paradoxes; they had
no more doctrinal value in my eyes than the thousand
other freaks so common to this celebrated critic. A
short time since, an obscure journal pretended that
Proudhon, in private conversations, had drawn up a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"> 35</a></span>
formula of an entire system based on masculine omnipotence,
and published this system in its columns. One
of two things is certain, said I to myself; either the journalist
speaks falsely, or he tells the truth; if he speaks
falsely, his evident aim is to destroy Proudhon in the
confidence of the friends of progress, and to make him
lose his lawful share of influence, in which case, he must
be warned of it; if he tells the truth, Proudhon must
still be warned of the fact, since it is impossible that, being
the father of <i>several daughters</i>, paternal feeling
should not have set him on the road to reason. At all
events, I must know about it. I wrote to Proudhon,
who, the next day, returned me an answer which I
transcribe <i>verbatim</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="titel">"<span class="cap">M</span><span class="smallc">ADAM</span>:</p>

<p>"I know nothing of the article published by
M. Charles Robin in the <i>Telegraphe</i> of yesterday. In
order to inform myself with regard to this paraphrase,
as you entitle the article of M. Robin, I examined my
first "Memoir on Property," page 265, Garnier edition,
(I have no other,) and found no note there. I examined
the same page in my other pamphlet, and discovered
no note anywhere. It is therefore impossible for me to
reply to your first question.</p>

<p>"I do not exactly know what you call <i>my opinions</i>
on woman, marriage and the family; for I believe I
have given no one a right to speak of my opinions on
these subjects, any more than on that of property.</p>

<p>"I have written economical and social criticisms; in
making these criticisms (I take the word in its highest
signification), I may have indeed expressed judgments
to a greater or less degree relative, concerning a truth.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"> 36</a></span>
I have no where that I know of, framed a dogma, a
theory, a collection of principles; in a word, a system.
All that I can tell you is, in the first place, as far as
concerns myself, that my opinions have been formed
progressively and in an unvarying direction; that, at the
time at which I write, I have not deviated from this direction;
and that, with this reserve, my existing opinions
accord perfectly with what they were seventeen
years ago when I published my first memoirs.</p>

<p>"In the second place, with regard to you, Madam,
who, in interrogating me do not leave me in ignorance
of your sentiments, I will tell you with all the
frankness which your letter exacts, and which you expect
from a compatriot, that I do not regard the question
of marriage, of woman, and of the family in the
same light as yourself, or any of the innovating authors
whose ideas have come to my knowledge; that I do not
admit, for instance, that woman has the right at the
present time to separate her cause from that of man, and
to demand for herself special legislation, as though her
chief tyrant and enemy were man; that further, I do
not admit that, whatever reparation may be due to woman,
of joint thirds with her husband (or father) and
her children, the most rigorous justice can ever make
her the <span class="smallc">EQUAL</span> of man; that neither do I admit that
this inferiority of the female sex constitutes for it either
servitude, or humiliation, or a diminution of dignity,
liberty, or happiness. I maintain that the contrary is
true.</p>

<p>"I consider, therefore, the sort of crusade that is being
carried on at this time by a few estimable ladies in
both hemispheres in behalf of the prerogatives of their
sex, as a symptom of the general renovation that is being
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"> 37</a></span>
wrought; but nevertheless, as an exaggerated symptom,
<i>an infatuation that proceeds precisely from the infirmity
of the sex and its incapacity to understand and
to govern itself</i>.</p>

<p>"I have read, Madam, a few of your articles. I find
that your wit, capacity and knowledge place you certainly
above an infinity of males who have nothing of
their sex but the proletary faculty. In this respect,
were it necessary to decide on your thesis by comparisons
of this kind, you would doubtless gain the cause.</p>

<p>"But you have too much good sense not to comprehend
that the question here is by no means to compare
individual with individual, but the whole feminine sex
in its aggregate with the whole masculine sex, in order
to know whether these two halves, the complements
of each other, are or are not equals in the human androgynus.</p>

<p>"In accordance with this principle, I do not believe
that your system, which is, I think, that of equality or
equivalence, can be sustained, and I regard it as a weakness
of our epoch.</p>

<p>"You have interrogated me, Madam, with Franche-Comtois
abruptness. I wish you to take my words in
good part, and, since I doubtless do not agree at all with
you, not to see in me an enemy of woman, a detractor
of your sex, worthy of the animadversions of maidens,
wives and mothers. The rules of fair discussion oblige
you to admit at least that you may be deceived, that I
may be right, that in such case it is I who am truly the
defender and friend of woman; I ask nothing more.</p>

<p>"You and your companions have raised a very great
question, which I think that you have hitherto treated
quite superficially. But the indifferent manner in which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"> 38</a></span>
this subject has been treated should not be considered as
conclusive reason for not receiving it; on the contrary,
I regard it as another reason for the advocates of the
equality of the two sexes to make greater efforts. In
this respect, Madam, I doubt not that you will signalize
yourself anew, and await with impatience the volume
that you announce, which I promise to read with all the
attention of which I am capable."</p>
</div>

<p class="space">On reading this letter, I transcribed the note which
M. Proudhon had not succeeded in finding, and sent it
to him, with the article of M. Charles Robin. As he
did not reply, his silence authorizes me to believe the
journalist.</p>

<p>Ah! you persist in maintaining that woman is inferior,
minor! you believe that women will bow devoutly
before the high decree of your autocracy! No, no; it
will not, it cannot be so. To battle, M. Proudhon!
But let us first dispose of the question of my personality.</p>

<p>You consider me as an exception, by telling me that,
if it were necessary to decide on my thesis by comparison
between a host of men and myself, the decision would
be, doubtless, in favor of my opinions. Mark my reply:</p>

<p>"<i>Every true law is absolute.</i> The ignorance or folly
of grammarians, moralists, jurisconsults, and other philosophers,
alone invented the proverb: There is no rule
without an exception. <i>The mania of imposing laws on
Nature, instead of studying Nature's own laws, afterwards
confirmed this aphorism of ignorance.</i>" Who
said this? You, in the "Creation of Order in Humanity."
Why is your letter in contradiction with this
doctrine?</p>

<p>Have you changed your opinion? Then I entreat
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"> 39</a></span>
you to tell me whether men of worth are not quite as
exceptional in their sex, as women of merit in theirs.
You have said: "Whatever may be the differences existing
between men, they are equal, because they are
human beings." Under penalty of inconsistency, you
must add: Whatever may be the differences existing
between the sexes, they are equal, because they form a
part of the human species&mdash;unless you prove that women
are not a part of humanity. Individual worth, not
being the basis of right between men, cannot become so
between the sexes. Your compliment is, therefore, a
contradiction.</p>

<p>I add, lastly, that I feel myself linked with my sex
by too close a solidarity ever to be content to see myself
abstracted from it by an illogical process. I am a woman&mdash;I
glory in it; I rejoice if any value is set upon
me, not for myself, indeed, but because this contributes
to modify the opinion of men with respect to my sex.
A woman who is happy in hearing it said: "<i>You are
a man</i>," is, in my eyes, a simpleton, an unworthy creature,
avowing the superiority of the masculine sex; and
the men who think that they compliment her in this
manner, are vainglorious and impertinent boasters. If
I acquire any desert, I thus pay honor to women, I reveal
their aptitudes, I do not pass into the other sex
any more than Proudhon abandons his own, because he
is elevated by his intellect above the level of foolish and
ignorant men; and if the ignorance of the mass of men
prejudges nothing against their right, no more does the
ignorance of the mass of women prejudge anything
against theirs.</p>

<p>You affirm that man and woman do not form <i>true
society</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"> 40</a></span>
Tell us, then, what is marriage, what is society.</p>

<p>You affirm that the difference of sex places between
man and woman a separation of the same nature <i>as
that which the difference of races places between animals</i>.
Then prove:</p>

<p>That the race is not essentially formed of two sexes;</p>

<p>That man and woman can be reproduced separately;</p>

<p>That their common product is a mixed breed, or a
mule;</p>

<p>That their characteristics are dissimilar, apart from
sexuality.</p>

<p>And if you come off with honor from this great feat
of strength, you will still have to prove:</p>

<p>That to difference of race corresponds difference <i>of
right</i>;</p>

<p>That the black, the yellow, the copper-colored persons
belonging to races inferior to the Caucasian cannot truly
associate with the latter; that they are minors.</p>

<p>Come, sir, study anthropology, physiology, and phrenology,
and employ your serial dialectics to prove all
this to us.</p>

<p>You are inclined to seclude woman, instead of emancipating
her?</p>

<p>Prove to men that they have the right to do so; to
women, that it is their duty to suffer themselves to be
placed under lock and key. I declare, for my part, that
I would not submit to it. Does Proudhon remember
how he threatens the priest who shall lay his hand on
his children? Well, the majority of women would not
confine themselves to threats against those who might
have the Mussulmanic inclination of Proudhon.</p>

<p>You affirm that by <i>nature</i>, and by <i>destination</i>, woman
is neither <i>associate</i>, nor <i>citizen</i>, nor <i>functionary</i>. Tell
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"> 41</a></span>
us, in the first place, <i>what nature</i> it is necessary to have
to be all these.</p>

<p>Reveal to us the <i>nature</i> of woman, since you claim
to know it better than she does herself.</p>

<p>Reveal to us her <i>destination</i>, which apparently is not
that which we see, nor which she believes to be such.</p>

<p>You affirm that woman, until her marriage, is nothing
more than <i>apprentice</i>, at most, under-superintendent
in the social workshop; that she is <i>minor</i> in the family,
and <i>does not form a part of the commonwealth</i>.</p>

<p>Prove, then, that she does not execute in the social
workshop and in the family works <i>equivalent</i>, or equal,
to those of man.</p>

<p>Prove that she is less useful than man.</p>

<p>Prove that the qualities that give to man the right of
citizenship, do not exist in woman.</p>

<p>I shall be severe with you on this head. To subordinate
woman in a social order in which she must <i>work
in order to live</i> is to <i>desire prostitution</i>; for disdain of
the producer extends to the value of the product; and
when such a doctrine is contrary to science, good sense,
and progress, to sustain it is <i>cruelty</i>, is <i>moral monstrosity</i>.
The woman who cannot live by working, can only
do so by prostituting herself; the equal of man or a
courtesan, such is the alternative. He is blind who
does not see it.</p>

<p>You see no other fate for woman than to be courtesan
or housewife. Open your eyes wider, and dream less,
and tell me whether all those useful and courageous
women are only housewives or courtesans, who support
themselves honorably by arts, literature, instruction;</p>

<p>Who found numerous and prosperous manufactures;</p>

<p>Who superintend commercial establishments;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"> 42</a></span>
Who are such good managers, that many among them
conceal or repair the faults resulting from the carelessness
or dissipation of their husbands.</p>

<p>Prove to us, therefore, that all this is wrong;</p>

<p>Prove to us that it is not the result of human progress;</p>

<p>Prove to us that labor, the stamp of the human species&mdash;that
labor, which you consider as the great emancipator&mdash;that
labor, which makes men equal and free,
has not virtue to make women equal and free. If you
prove this to us, we shall have to register one contradiction
more.</p>

<p>You do not admit that woman should have the right
of claiming for herself special legislation, as though man
were her chief enemy and tyrant.</p>

<p>You, sir, are the one that legislates specially for woman;
she herself desires nothing but the common law.</p>

<p>Yes; until now, man, in subordinating woman, has
been her tyrant and enemy. I am of your opinion
when, in your first "Memoir on Property," you say
that, so long as the strong and the weak are not <i>equals</i>,
they are <i>strangers</i>, they cannot form an alliance, <i>they
are enemies</i>. Yes, thrice yes, so long as man and woman
are not equals, woman is in the right in considering
man as her <i>tyrant</i> and <i>enemy</i>.</p>

<p>"The most rigorous justice cannot make woman the
<span class="smallc">EQUAL</span> of man." And it is to a woman whom you set
in your opinion above a host of men, that you affirm
such a thing! What a contradiction!</p>

<p>"It is <i>an infatuation</i> for women to demand their
right!" <i>An infatuation</i> like that of slaves, pretending
that they were created freemen; of the citizens of '89,
proving that men are equal before the law. Do you
know who were, who are the infatuated? The masters,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"> 43</a></span>
the nobles, the whites, the men who have denied, who
do deny, and who will deny, that slaves, citizens, blacks,
and women, are born for liberty and equality.</p>

<p>"The sex to which I belong is incapable of understanding
and governing itself," say you!</p>

<p>Prove that it is destitute of intellect;</p>

<p>Prove that great empresses and great queens have not
governed as well as great emperors and great kings;</p>

<p>Prove against all the facts patent that women are not
in general good observers and good managers;</p>

<p>Then prove that all men understand themselves perfectly
and govern themselves admirably, and that progress
moves as if on wheels.</p>

<p>"Woman is neither the <i>half</i> nor the <i>equal</i> of man;
she is <i>the complement that finally makes him an individual</i>;
the two sexes form <i>the human androgynus</i>."
Come; seriously, what means this jingle of empty words?
They are metaphors, unworthy to figure in scientific
language, when our own and the other higher zoölogical
species are in question. The lioness, the she-wolf
and the tigress are no more the halves or the complement
of their species than woman is the complement of
man. Or Nature has established two <i>exteriorities</i>, two
wills, she affirms two unities, two entireties not one,
or <i>two halves</i>; the arithmetic of Nature cannot be destroyed
by the freaks of the imagination.</p>

<p>Is equality before the law based upon <i>individual</i> qualities?
Proudhon replies in the "Creation of Order in
Humanity":</p>

<p>"Neither birth, nor figure, <i>nor faculties</i>, nor fortune,
nor rank, nor profession, nor talent, nor anything that
distinguishes individuals establishes between them a difference
of species; all being men, and <i>the law regulating
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"> 44</a></span>
only human relations, it is the same for all</i>; so that
to establish exceptions, it would be necessary to prove
that the individuals excepted are <i>above</i> or <i>beneath</i> the
human species."</p>

<p>Prove to us that women are <i>above</i> or <i>beneath</i> the human
species, that they do not form a part of it, or, <i>under
penalty of contradiction</i>, submit to the consequences of
your doctrine.</p>

<p>You say in the "Social Revolution;"</p>

<p>"Neither conscience, nor reason, nor liberty, nor labor,
pure forces, <i>primary and creative faculties</i>, can be
made mechanical without being destroyed. Their reason
of existence is in themselves; in their works they
should find their reason of action. In this consists the
human person, a sacred person, etc."</p>

<p>Prove that women have neither conscience, nor reason,
nor moral liberty, and that they do not labor. If it is
demonstrated that they possess the <i>primary and creative
faculties</i>, respect their human person, for it is sacred.</p>

<p>In the "Creation of Order in Humanity," you say:</p>

<p>"Specifically, labor satisfies the desire of our personality,
which tends invincibly to make a difference between
itself and others, <i>to render itself independent</i>, <i>to
conquer its liberty</i> and its character."</p>

<p>Prove then that women have no special work, and, if
facts contradict you, acknowledge that, it inevitably
tends to <i>independence</i>, to <i>liberty</i>.</p>

<p>Do you deny that they are your equals because they
are less intelligent as a whole than men? In the first
place, I contest it; but I need not do so, you yourself resolve
this difficulty in the "Creation of Order in Humanity:"</p>

<p>"The inequality of capacities, when not caused by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"> 45</a></span>
constitutional vices, mutilation or want, results from
general ignorance, insufficient method, lack or falsity of
education, and divergence of intuition through lack of
sequence, whence arises dispersion and confusion of ideas.
Now, all these facts productive of inequality are essentially
abnormal, therefore the inequality of capacities is
abnormal."</p>

<p>Unless you prove that women are mutilated by Nature,
I do not exactly see how you can escape the consequences
of your syllogism: not only has feminine inferiority
the same sources as masculine ignorance, but
public education is refused to women, the great professional
schools are closed to them, those who through
their intellect equal the most intelligent among you have
had twenty times as many difficulties and prejudices to
overcome.</p>

<p>You wish to subordinate women because in general
they have less muscular force than you; but at this rate
the weak men ought not to be the equals of the strong,
and you combat this consequence yourself in your first
"Memoir on Property," where you say:</p>

<p>"Social equilibrium is the equalization of the strong
and the weak."</p>

<p>If I have treated you with consideration, it is because
you are an intelligent and progressive man, and
because it is impossible that you should remain under
the influence of the doctors of the Middle Age on one
question, while you are in advance of the majority of
your cotemporaries on so many others. You will cease
to sustain an illogical series that is without foundation,
remembering, as you have said so well in the "Creation
of Order in Humanity:"</p>

<p>"That the greater part of philosophical aberrations
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"> 46</a></span>
and chimeras have arisen from attributing to logical series
a reality that they do not possess, and endeavoring
to explain the nature of man by abstractions."</p>

<p>You will acknowledge that all the higher animal species
are composed of two sexes;</p>

<p>That in none is the female the inferior of the male,
except sometimes through force, which cannot be the basis
of human right;</p>

<p>You will renounce the androgynus, which is only a
dream.</p>

<p>Woman, a distinct individual, endowed with consciousness,
intellect, will and activity like man, will be
no longer separated from him before the laws.</p>

<p>You will say of all, both men and women, as in your
first "Memoir on Property:"</p>

<p>"Liberty is an absolute right, because it is to man
what impenetrability is to matter, a condition <i>sine qua
non</i> of existence. Equality is an <i>absolute right</i>, because
without equality, there is no society."</p>

<p>And you will thus show the second degree of sociability,
which you yourself define, "the recognition in
another of a personality <i>equal</i> to our own."</p>

<p>I appeal therefore from Proudhon drunk with theology
to Proudhon sobered by facts and science, moved by the
sorrows and disorders resulting from his own systems.</p>

<p>I hope I shall not encounter his Herculean club raised
against the holy banner of truth and right; against woman,&mdash;that
being physically so weak, morally so strong,
who, bleeding, and steeped in gall beneath her crown of
roses, is just on the point of reaching the top of the
rough mountain where progress will shortly give her
her lawful place by the side of man. But if my hopes
are deceitful, mark me well, M. Proudhon, you will find
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"> 47</a></span>
me standing firmly in the breach, and, whatever may be
your strength, I vow that you shall not overthrow me.
I will courageously defend the right and dignity of your
daughters against the despotism and logical error of
their father, and the victory will remain mine, for, definitively,
it always belongs to truth."</p>

<p>Proudhon replied by the following letter in the <i>Revue
Philosophique</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="titel">"<span class="cap">T</span><span class="smallc">O</span> <span class="cap">M</span><span class="smallc">ADAME d'</span><span class="cap">H</span><span class="smallc">ÉRICOURT</span>.</p>

<p class="i2">"Well, Madam, what did I tell you in my
last letter?</p>

<p>"I consider the sort of crusade that is being carried
on at this time by some estimable ladies in both hemispheres
in behalf of their sex, as a symptom of the general
revolution that is being wrought; but nevertheless
as an exaggerated symptom, an infatuation that proceeds
precisely from the inferiority of the sex and its incapacity
to understand and to govern itself.</p>

<p>"I begin by withdrawing the word <i>infatuation</i>, which
may have wounded you, but which was not, as you
know, intended for publicity.</p>

<p>"This point adjusted, I will tell you, Madam, with
all the respect that I owe you as a woman, that I did
not expect to see you confirm my judgment so speedily
by your petulant appeal.</p>

<p>"I was at first at a loss to know whence came the
discontent that impelled the bravest, the most distinguished
among you, to an assault on paternal and marital
supremacy. I said to myself, not without disquietude,
What is the matter? What is it that troubles
them? With what do they reproach us? To which
of our faculties, our virtues, our prerogatives; or else of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"> 48</a></span>
our failings, our perfidies, our calamities, do they aspire?
Is this the cry of their outraged nature, or an
aberration of their understanding?</p>

<p>"Your attack, joined to the studies which I immediately
commenced on the subject, came at last to solve
the question.</p>

<p>"No, Madam, you know nothing of your sex; you
do not know the first word of the question that you and
your honorable confederates are agitating with so much
noise and so little success. And, if you do not comprehend
this question; if, in your eight pages of reply to
my letter, there are forty paralogisms, it results precisely,
as I have told you, from your <i>sexual infirmity</i>. I mean
by this word, the exactness of which is not, perhaps, irreproachable,
the quality of your understanding, which
permits you to seize the relation of things only as far as
we, men, place your finger upon them. You have in
the brain, as in the body, a certain organ incapable by
itself of overcoming its native inertia, and which the
masculine spirit alone is capable of setting in motion;
and even this does not always succeed. Such, Madam,
is the result of my direct and positive observations; I
make them over to your obstetrical sagacity, and leave
you to calculate therefrom the incalculable consequences
to your thesis.</p>

<p>"I will willingly enter into an elaborate discussion
with you, Madam, on this obscure subject, in the <i>Revue
Philosophique</i>. But&mdash;as you will comprehend as well as
I&mdash;the broader the question, the more it affects our most
sacred, social, and domestic interests, the more important
is it that we should approach it with seriousness
and prudence.</p>

<p>"The following course, therefore, appears to me indispensable:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"> 49</a></span>
In the first place, you have promised us a
book, and I await it. I need this work to complete my
documents and to finish my demonstration. Since I
had the honor of receiving and replying to your letter,
I have made earnest and interesting studies on woman,
which I ask only to rectify if they are erroneous; as I
also desire to set a seal on them if, as I have every reason
to presume, your publication brings me but one confirmation
more.</p>

<p>"I have verified by facts and documents the truth of
all the assertions which you call on me to retract,
namely:</p>

<p>"That the difference of sex raises up between man and
woman a separation <span class="smallc">ANALOGOUS</span>&mdash;I did not say equal&mdash;to
that which the difference of races and species establishes
between animals;</p>

<p>"That by reason of this separation or difference, man
and woman are not <i>associates</i>; I did not say that they
could not be anything else;</p>

<p>"That, consequently, woman can only be a <i>citizen</i>
in so far as she is the wife of a citizen; as we say <i>Madame
la Presidente</i> to the wife of a President: which
does not imply that no other rôle exists for her.</p>

<p>"In two words, I am in a position to establish, by
observation and reasoning, the facts, that woman, being
weaker than man with respect to <i>muscular force</i>, as you
yourself acknowledge, is not less inferior to him with
respect to <span class="smallc">INDUSTRIAL</span>, <span class="smallc">ARTISTIC</span>, <span class="smallc">PHILOSOPHICAL</span> and
<span class="smallc">MORAL POWER</span>; so that if the condition of woman in
society be regulated, as you demand for her, by the
same justice as the condition of man, it is all over with
her, she is a slave.</p>

<p>"To which I add, immediately, that this system is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"> 50</a></span>
precisely what I reject: the principle of pure, rigorous
right, of that terrible right which the Roman compared
to an unsheathed sword, <i>jus strictum</i>, and which rules
individuals of the same sex among themselves, being
different from that which governs the relations between
individuals of different sexes.</p>

<p>"What is this principle, differing from justice, and
which, notwithstanding, would not exist without justice;
which all men feel in the depth of their souls, and
of which you women alone have no idea? Is it love?
nothing more? I leave it to you to divine. And if
your penetration succeeds in clearing up this mystery,
I consent, Madam, to sign you a certificate of genius;
<i>Et eris mihi magnus Apollo</i>. But then you will have
given me the cause.</p>

<p>"Such, Madam, in a few words, are the conclusions
to which I have arrived, and which the reading of your
book surely will not modify. Notwithstanding, as it is
absolutely possible that your personal observations may
have led you to diametrically opposite results, good faith
in the discussion and respect for our readers and ourselves
exact that, before entering upon the controversy,
a reciprocal interchange of all the documents that we
have collected should be made between us. You may
take cognizance of mine.</p>

<p>"One other condition, which I entreat you, Madam,
to take in good part, and from which I shall not depart
under any pretext, is that you shall choose yourself a
male sponsor.</p>

<p>"You, who have declared yourself so energetically
on this point, would not wish your adversary to make
the least sacrifice to gallantry in so serious a discussion;
and you are right. But I, Madam, who am so far from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"> 51</a></span>
admitting your pretensions, cannot thus release myself
from the obligations which manly and honorable civility
prescribes towards ladies; and as I propose, besides, to
make you serve as a subject of experiment; as, after
having made the autopsy of five or six women of the
greatest merit for the instruction of my readers, I count
also on making yours, you will conceive that it is quite
impossible for me to argue from you, of you, and with
you, without exposing myself at every word to a violation
of all the rules of conventionality.</p>

<p>"I know, Madam, that such a condition will annoy
you; it is one of the disadvantages of your position to
which you must submit courageously. You are a plaintiff,
and, as a woman, you affirm that you are oppressed.
Appear, then, before the judgment seat of incorruptible
public opinion with this tyrannous chain which rouses
your ire, and which, according to me, exists only in
your disordered imagination. You will be but the more
interesting for it. Besides, you would deride me if,
while sustaining the superiority of man, I should begin
by according to you the equality of woman by disputing
with you on an equal footing of companionship. You
have not counted, I imagine, upon my falling into this
inconsistency.</p>

<p>"You will not lack for champions, besides. I expect
of your courtesy, Madam, that he whom you shall select
as my antagonist, who will sign and affirm all your articles,
and assume the responsibility of your affirmations
and replies, shall be worthy of both you and me; so
that, in fine, I shall not have a right to complain that
you have pitted me against a man of straw.</p>

<p>"What has most surprised me, since this hypothesis
of the equality of the sexes, renewed by the Greeks as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"> 52</a></span>
well as by many others, has become known among us,
has been to see that it numbered among its partisans
almost as many men as women. I sought a long time
for the reason of this strange fact, which I at first attributed
to chivalric zeal; I think now that I have
found it. It is not to the advantage of the knights. I
shall be glad, Madam, for their sake and yours, if this
serious examination should prove that the new emancipators
of woman are the most lofty, the broadest, and
the most progressive, if not the most masculine minds
of the age.</p>

<p>"You say, Madam, that women have a weakness for
soldiers. It is doubtless on this account that you have
lashed me soundly. <i>He who loveth, chasteneth.</i> When
I was three years and a half old, my mother, to get rid
of me, sent me to a school-mistress of the neighborhood,
an excellent woman, called Madelon. One day she
threatened to whip me for some piece of mischief. It
made me furious. I snatched her switch from her hand,
and flung it in her face. I was always a disobedient
subject. I shall be glad, therefore, to find that you do
not assume towards me castigating airs, which it does
not belong to a man to return; but I leave this to your
discretion. Strike, redouble the blows, do not spare me;
and if I should chance to grow restive under the rod,
believe me none the less, Madam, your affectionate servant
and compatriot,</p>

<p class="signature">"<span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON</span>."</p>
</div>

<p class="space">Taking up the discussion in turn, I replied as follows,
in the ensuing February number:&mdash;</p>

<p class="space">I am forbidden, sir, to answer your letter in the indecorous
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"> 53</a></span>
style which you have deemed proper to assume
towards me:</p>

<p>By respect for the gravity of my subject;</p>

<p>By respect for our readers;</p>

<p>By respect for myself.</p>

<p>You find yourself ill at ease in the Popilian circle
that has been traced around you by the hand of a woman;
all understand this, I among the rest. Ill-armed
for defence, worse armed, perhaps, for attack, you would
like to escape; but your skill as a tactician will avail
you nothing; you shall not quit the fatal circle till vanquished,
either by me, or by yourself, if you confess
your weakness on the point in litigation, by continuing
to refuse a discussion under flimsy pretexts, or, lastly,
by public opinion, which will award to you the quality
of inconsistency, the least desirable of all to a dialectician.</p>

<p>This being understood, I must tell you that, personally,
I am satisfied that you should attack, in <i>the rights
of woman</i>, the cause of justice and progress. It is an
augury of success to this cause; you have always been
fatal to all that you have sought to sustain.</p>

<p>It is true that your attitude in this question makes
you <i>the ally of the dogmatism of the Middle Age</i>; it
is true that the <i>official representatives</i> of this dogmatism
avail themselves, at the present time, of your arguments
and your name to maintain their influence over
women, and through them over men and children; and
this in order to revive the past, to stifle the future. Is
this your intention? I do not believe it. You are, in
my eyes, a subverter, a destroyer, in whom instinct
sometimes gets the better of intellect, and from whom
it shuts out a clear view of the consequences of his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"> 54</a></span>
writings. Formed for strife, you must have adversaries;
and, in default of enemies, you cruelly fall on those who
are fighting in the same ranks with yourself. In all
your writings, one feels that the second part of education&mdash;that
which inspires respect and love of woman&mdash;is
completely wanting in you.</p>

<p>Let us come to your letter.</p>

<p>You reproach me with having made <i>forty paralogisms</i>;
it was your duty at least to have cited one of
these. However, let us see.</p>

<p>You say: between man and woman there is a separation
of <i>the same nature as that which the difference of
race establishes between animals</i>.</p>

<p>Woman, by nature and destination, is <i>neither associate,
nor citizen, nor functionary</i>.</p>

<p>She is, until marriage, only <i>apprentice</i>, at most, <i>under-superintendent</i>
in the social workshop; she is a <i>minor</i>
in the family, and <i>does not form a part of the commonwealth</i>.</p>

<p>You conceive of no destiny for her outside of the
household: she can be only <i>housewife</i> or <i>courtesan</i>.</p>

<p>She is incapable <i>of understanding and of governing
herself</i>.</p>

<p>To make a paralogism is to draw a conclusion from
false premises; now did I conclude from such in saying:</p>

<p>In order that all these paradoxes may become truths,
you have to prove:</p>

<p>That man and woman are not of the same race;</p>

<p>That they can be reproduced separately;</p>

<p>That their common product is a mixed breed or a mule;</p>

<p>That difference of races corresponds to difference of
rights.</p>

<p>You have to define for us an association, and also the
nature of a citizen or a functionary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"> 55</a></span>
You have to prove that woman is less useful than man
in society;</p>

<p>That, at the present time, she is necessarily a housewife,
when she is not a courtesan;</p>

<p>That she is destitute of intellect, that she knows nothing
of government.</p>

<p>You pretend that woman has not a right <i>to demand
for herself special legislation</i>.</p>

<p>Was I guilty of a paralogism in pointing out to you
that it is not she, <i>but you</i>, who demand this, since
you lay down as a principle the inequality of the sexes
before human law?</p>

<p>All that you say relatively to the <i>pretended</i> inferiority
of woman and the conclusions which you draw from
it applying to human races inferior to our own, it would
be easy for me to demonstrate that the consequence of
your principles is the <i>re-establishment of slavery</i>. The
nearest perfect has the right to take advantage of the
weakest, instead of becoming his educator. An admirable
doctrine, full of the spirit of progress, full of generosity!
I compliment you most sincerely on it.</p>

<p>You say that labor specialized is the great emancipator
of man; that labor, conscience, liberty, and reason,
find only in themselves their right to exist and to act;
that these pure forces constitute the human person,
<i>which is sacred</i>.</p>

<p>You lay down the principle that the law is the same
for all; so that, to establish exceptions, it would be necessary
to prove that the individuals excepted are <i>above</i>
or <i>beneath</i> the human species.</p>

<p>You say that social equilibrium is the equalization of
the strong and the weak; that all have the same rights,
not through that which distinguishes them from each
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"> 56</a></span>
other, but through <i>that which is common to them</i>,&mdash;<i>the
quality of human beings</i>.</p>

<p>Was I guilty of paralogisms in saying to you:</p>

<p>Then you cannot, by reason of her weakness or even
of a supposed inferiority, exclude woman from equality
of right: your principles interdict it, unless you prove:</p>

<p><i>That she is superior or inferior to the human species,
and that she does not form a part of it;</i></p>

<p><i>That she is destitute of conscience, of justice, and of
reason; that she does not labor, that she does not execute
specialties of labor.</i></p>

<p>It is evident, that your doctrine concerning general
right is in contradiction to your doctrine concerning the
right of women; it is evident that you are very inconsequent,
and that, however skillful you may be, you
cannot extricate yourself from this embarrassment.</p>

<p>In what you call an answer, there are a few passages
that are worth the trouble of pausing to consider.</p>

<p>You ask <i>what impels the bravest, the most distinguished
among us to an assault on paternal and marital
supremacy</i>.</p>

<p>You do not comprehend the movement, or you would
have said <i>masculine supremacy</i>.</p>

<p>In my turn, I ask you:</p>

<p>What would have impelled Proudhon, a Roman slave,
to play the part of Spartacus?</p>

<p>What would have impelled Proudhon, a feudal serf,
to organize a Jacquerie?</p>

<p>What would have impelled Proudhon, a black slave,
to become a Toussaint L'Ouverture?</p>

<p>What would have impelled Proudhon, a Russian serf,
to take the character of Poutgachef?</p>

<p>What would have impelled Proudhon, a citizen of '89,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"> 57</a></span>
to overthrow the privileges of the nobility and the
clergy?</p>

<p>What would impel Proudhon ... but I will not
touch on reality.</p>

<p>What would Proudhon have replied to all the holders
of <i>prerogatives</i> and <i>supremacy</i>, who would not have
failed on their part to have put to him the naïve question:
"Ah! what does this vile slave, this unworthy serf,
this audacious and stupid citizen want of us, then? <i>To
which of our faculties, our virtues, our prerogatives does
he aspire? Is this the cry of his outraged nature, or an
aberration of his understanding?</i>"</p>

<p>The answer that Proudhon would make, is that which
will be made to him by all women who have attained
majority.</p>

<p>There is in the brain of woman, say you, an organ
which the masculine mind alone is capable of setting in
motion. Render the service then to science of pointing
it out and demonstrating its manner of working. As
to the other organ of which you speak, it is its inertia,
doubtless, that has caused it to be defined by some, <i>parvum
animal furibondum, octo ligamentis alligatum</i>.
Before choosing anatomical and physiological facts as
proofs of your assertions, consult some learned physician;
such is the counsel given you, not only by my <i>obstetrical,
but also by my medical sagacity</i>.</p>

<p>You offer to acquaint me with your <i>direct</i> and <i>positive</i>
observations. What, Sir! has it been possible for
you in a few weeks to delve into the depths of the
healthy and the diseased organization! to go through
the whole labyrinth of functions implicated in the questions.
It is more than miraculous; despite my good
will, I cannot believe it, unless you prove that you are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"> 58</a></span>
a <i>prophet</i> in communication with some deity. Shall I
tell you what I really think? It is that you have studied
these matters neither <i>directly</i> nor <i>indirectly</i>, and
that it belongs to me to tell you <i>that you do not understand
woman; that you do not know the first word of
the question</i>. Your five or six <i>purely</i> moral and intellectual
autopsies prove only one thing; namely, your
inexperience in physiology. You have naïvely mistaken
the scalpel of your imagination for that of science.</p>

<p>With regard to autopsies, you tell me that you are
awaiting my promised work, in order to make mine. It
would be doubtless a great honor to be stretched on
your dissecting table in such good company as you
promise me, but the instruction of my future readers
does not permit me to enjoy this satisfaction. I shall
not send my book to press until your own shall have appeared,
for I, too, intend to make your autopsy; dissect
me therefore now; I promise you on my side that I
will perform my duty conscientiously, properly and delicately.</p>

<p>"Woman," you say, "being weaker than man with
respect to <i>muscular force</i>, is not less inferior to him with
respect to <span class="smallc">INDUSTRIAL, ARTISTIC, PHILOSOPHICAL AND
MORAL POWER</span>; so that if the condition of woman in
society be regulated, as you demand for her, <i>by the
same justice as the condition of man</i>, it is all over with
her; she is a slave."</p>

<p>Terrible man, you will be then always inconsistent,
you will always contradict yourself and facts!</p>

<p>What do you hold as the basis of right? <i>The simple
quality of being human</i>; everything that distinguishes
individuals disappears before right. Well! even though
it were true that women were inferior to men, would
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"> 59</a></span>
it follow that their rights were not the same? According
to you, by no means, if they form a part of the
human species. There are not two kinds of justice,
there is but one; there are not two kinds of right, there
is but one in the absolute sense. The recognition and
respect of individual autonomy in the lowest of human
beings as well as in the man and woman of genius is
the law which should preside over social relations; must
a woman tell you this!</p>

<p>Let us now examine the value of your series of <i>man
and woman</i>.</p>

<p>With respect to the reproduction of the species, they
form a series; this is beyond dispute.</p>

<p>As to the rest, do they form a series? No.</p>

<p><i>If it were a law</i> that woman is <i>muscularly</i> weaker
than man, the strongest woman would be weaker than
the weakest man; facts demonstrate the contrary daily.</p>

<p><i>If it were a law</i> that women are inferior to men in
<i>industrial power</i>, the most skillful woman would be inferior
in industrial pursuits to the least skillful man;
now facts demonstrate daily that there are women who
are excellent manufacturers and excellent managers;
men who are unskilled in and unsuited to this kind of
pursuits.</p>

<p><i>If it were a law</i> that women are inferior to men in
<i>artistic power</i>, the best female artist would be inferior
to the most indifferent male artist; now facts daily demonstrate
the contrary; there are more great female
than male tragedians; many men are mediocre in music
and painting, and many women, on the other hand, remarkable
in both respects, etc., etc.</p>

<p>What follows from all this? That your series is false,
since facts destroy it. How did you form it? The process
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"> 60</a></span>
is a curious study. You chose a few remarkable
men, in whom, by a convenient process of abstraction,
you beheld <i>all</i> men, even to cretins; you here took a
few women, without taking into account in the slightest
degree any differences of culture, instruction, and surroundings,
and compared them with these eminent men,
taking care to forget those that might have embarrassed
you; then, deducing generals from particulars, creating
two entities, you drew your conclusions. A strange
manner of reasoning, truly! You have fallen into the
mania of <i>imposing rules on Nature, instead of studying
Nature's rules</i>, and deserve that I should apply your
own words to you: "The greatest part of the philosophical
aberrations and chimeras have arisen from attributing
to logical series <i>a reality that they do not possess,
and endeavoring to explain the nature of man by
abstractions</i>."</p>

<p>Still, if this were to strengthen your doctrines concerning
the <i>basis</i> of right, it might be comprehended;
but it is to overthrow them!</p>

<p>You transform yourself into a Sphinx, to propose to
me a riddle. "What is that right," you say, "<i>which
is not justice, and which, notwithstanding, would not
exist without it</i>, which presides over the relations of
both sexes, the <i>jus strictum</i> governing only individuals
of the same sex. If you divine it, you will have given
me the cause."</p>

<p>It is not necessary to be <i>the great Apollo</i>, to divine
that it is the <i>right of grace, of mercy</i>, towards an inferior
that is not armed with strict right.</p>

<p>If I have divined rightly, you have simply begged
the question by supposing <i>that resolved which I dispute</i>.
I maintain that there is only one <i>right</i>, that <i>one single</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"> 61</a></span>
<i>right presides over the rights of individuals and of
sexes</i>, and that the right of mercy belongs to the domain
of sentiment.</p>

<p>You wish it proved that the new emancipators of woman
are the most elevated, the broadest, and the most
progressive minds of the age. Rejoice, your wish is accomplished:
a simple comparison between them and
their adversaries will prove it to you.</p>

<p>The emancipators, taking woman in the cradle of
humanity, see her marching slowly towards civil emancipation.
The intelligent disciples of progress, they
wish, by extending a fraternal hand to her, to aid her
in fulfilling her destiny.</p>

<p>The non-emancipators, denying the historical law, regardless
of the progressive and parallel movement of
the populace, woman, and the industrial arts towards
affranchisement, wish to thrust her back far beyond the
Middle Age, to the days of Romulus and the Hebrew
patriarchs.</p>

<p>The emancipators, believing in individual autonomy,
respecting it, and recognizing it in woman, wish to aid
her to conquer it. Judging of the need that a free
being has of liberty by the need that they have of it
themselves, they are consistent.</p>

<p>The non-emancipators, blinded by pride, perverted
by a love of dominion as unbridled as unintelligent, desire
liberty only <i>for themselves</i>. These egotists, so suspicious
of those that menace their own freedom, wish
half the human species to be in their chains.</p>

<p>The emancipators have enough heart and ideality to
desire a companion with whom they can exchange sentiment
and thought, and who can improve them in
some respects and be improved by them in others;
they love and respect woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"> 62</a></span>
The non-emancipators, without ideality, without love,
chained to their senses and their pride, despise woman;
and wish to have in her only a <i>female, a servant, a machine
to produce young ones</i>. They are <i>males, they are
not yet men</i>.</p>

<p>The emancipators desire perfection of the species, in
a three-fold point of view: physical, moral, and intellectual.
They know that races cannot be improved
without selecting and perfecting the mothers.</p>

<p>The non-emancipators are bent upon something quite
different from the improvement of the species: let their
children be lacking in intelligence, malicious, ugly, or
deformed; they think much less of this than of being
<i>masters</i>. Do they know enough of physiology to have
reflected that the faculties <i>depend on organization</i>, that
organization is capable of modification, that modifications
are transmitted, that woman has a great share in
this transmission, a greater share, perhaps, than that of
man? It is therefore <i>essential</i> to place her in a condition
to perform this great function in the manner most
useful to humanity.</p>

<p>The emancipators desire humanity to go forward, to
vibrate no longer between the past and the future; they
know the influence that women possess, first over children,
then over men; they know that woman cannot
serve progress <i>unless she finds it to her interest to do
so</i>; that she will find it so only through liberty; that
she will love it only if her intellect is elevated by study,
and her heart purified from the petty selfishness of home
by the predominating love of the great human family.
As they desire the end sincerely, they sincerely desire
the means; so long as half the human race shall labor
as it is doing to destroy the edifice constructed by <i>a few</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"> 63</a></span>
<i>members</i> of the other half; so long as half the human
race, <i>the one that secretly governs the other</i>, shall have
its face turned towards the past, the landmarks that
point to the future will be threatened with being torn
up. Do you consider it a crime in the emancipators to
comprehend this, to seek to conjure down the peril; and
do you consider a virtue in the non-emancipators the
foolish pride that places a cataract over their eyes?</p>

<p>A few words more, and I shall have done. You
would rather, you say, that I should not assume castigating
airs with you. But have you really the right to
complain of it, you who have constituted yourself the
chief whipper-in of the economists and the socialists?
I shall never go so far towards you as you have gone
towards them. You must resign yourself to my abrupt,
sometimes harsh style. I am implacable towards
whatever appears to me false and unjust; and were you
my brother, I should not war against you less sharply;
before all ties of affection and family, should come the
love of justice and humanity.</p>

<p>I owe now to my readers and to you, sir, the exposition
of the thesis that I undertake to sustain; for the
phrase, <i>the emancipation of women</i> has been, and is,
quite variously interpreted.</p>

<p>With respect to <i>right</i>, man and woman are equal,
whether the equality of faculties be admitted or rejected.</p>

<p>But for a truth to be useful, it must be adapted to
the surroundings into which we seek to introduce it.</p>

<p>Absolute right being recognized, the practice of it
remains. In practice, I see two kinds of rights: woman
is ripe for the exercise of one of them; but I acknowledge
that the practice of the second would be at present
dangerous, by reason of the education that the majority
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"> 64</a></span>
of them have received. You comprehend me, without
making it necessary for me to explain myself more
clearly in a Review in which social and political subjects
are interdicted.</p>

<p>The directors of the <i>Revue</i> having informed me that
my adversary refused to continue the discussion, I made
the following recapitulation of his creed, concerning the
rights and nature of woman.</p>

<p>To the editors of the <i>Revue Philosophique et Religieuse</i>:</p>

<p>You inform me that M. Proudhon will not reply
to the questions that I have put to him; I have neither
the means nor the wish to constrain him to do
so. I shall not inquire into the motives of his determination;
my business now is only to make an exposition
of his creed, which may be summed up in this wise:</p>

<p>"I believe that between man and woman, there is a
separation of the same nature as that which the difference
of race places between animals;</p>

<p>"I believe that, by nature and by destination, woman
is neither associate, nor functionary, nor citizen;</p>

<p>"I believe that, in the social workshop, she is, until
her marriage, only apprentice, at most under-superintendent;</p>

<p>"I believe that she is a minor in the family, art,
science, manufactures, and philosophy, and that she is
<i>nothing</i> in the commonwealth;</p>

<p>"I believe that she can only be housewife or courtesan;</p>

<p>"I believe that she is incapable of understanding
and of governing herself;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"> 65</a></span>
"I believe firmly that the basis of the equality of
rights is in the simple quality of being human; now, woman
being unable to have rights equal to those of man, I
affirm that she does not belong to the human species."</p>

<p>Is Proudhon conscious how far his creed is in opposition
to science, to facts, to the law of progress, to
the tendencies of our own age, and does he dare to attempt
to justify it by proofs?</p>

<p>Does he feel that this creed classes him among the
abettors of the dogmatism of the Middle Age, and does
he recoil before such a responsibility?</p>

<p>If this were the case, I should praise him for his
prudent silence, and it would be my warmest desire that
he should keep it forever on the question that divides us.
To treat a subject, it is necessary to love and understand
it; I dare not say that Proudhon does not love woman,
but I do affirm that he does not understand her; he
sees in her nothing more than the female of man; his
peculiar organization seems to render him unfit for the
investigation of such a subject. He promises, in the
work that he is preparing, to treat of the sphere and the
rights of women; if his doctrine has for its basis the
paradoxical affirmations of his creed, I hope that he will
this time take pains to rest them at least upon the semblances
of proofs, which I shall examine with all the attention
of which I am capable.</p>

<p>By shrinking from discussion, he cannot escape my
criticism.</p>

<p class="space">The two studies of Proudhon are simply the development
of this creed.</p>

<p>I promised to dissect the author; therefore, I shall
do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"> 66</a></span>
Let me not be reproached with being pitiless; Proudhon
has deserved it.</p>

<p>Let me not be reproached with being a reasoning
machine; with such an adversary, one should be nothing
else.</p>

<p>Let me not be reproached with being harsh; Proudhon
has shown a harshness and injustice with respect
to women, even the most illustrious, that exceed all
bounds. If I am harsh, I will endeavor on my part
not to be unjust.</p>

<p class="subh">I.</p>

<p>Well, M. Proudhon, you have sought war with women!
War you shall have.</p>

<p>You have said, not without reason, that the Comtois
are an obstinate race; now, I am your countrywoman;
and as woman generally carries virtues and failings farther
than man, I intend to outdo you in obstinacy.</p>

<p>I have raised the banner under which your daughters
will one day take shelter if they are worthy of the name
they bear; I will hold it with a firm hand and will never
suffer it to be struck down; against such as you, I
have the heart and claws of a lioness.</p>

<p>You begin by saying that you by no means desired to
treat of the inequality of the sexes, but that half a dozen
insurgent women with ink-stained fingers having defied
you to discuss the question, you will establish by facts
and documents the <i>physical, intellectual and moral inferiority
of woman</i>; that you will prove that her emancipation
is the same thing as her prostitution, and will
take her defence in hand against the rambling talk of a
few impure women whom sin has rendered mad.&mdash;(<i>Vol.</i>
III., p. 337.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"> 67</a></span>
I alone, by shutting you up in a circle of contradictions,
have dared defy you to discuss the question; I
sum up, therefore, in my own person, the few impure
women whom sin has rendered mad.</p>

<p>Insults of this sort cannot touch me; the esteem, the
regard, the precious friendship of eminently respectable
men and women suffice to reduce unworthy insinuations
to naught. I should not notice them, with such contempt
do they inspire me, were it not necessary to tell
you that the time has gone by when one might hope to
stifle the voice of a woman by attacking her purity.</p>

<p>If you do not ask the man who demands his rights
and seeks to prove their legitimacy, whether he is upright,
chaste, etc., no more have you the right to ask
the question of the woman who makes the same claim.</p>

<p>Were I therefore so unfortunate as to be the vilest of
mortals as regards chastity, this would not at all lessen
the value of my claim.</p>

<p>I greatly dislike any justification, but I owe it to the
sacred cause that I defend, I owe it to my friends, to
tell you that the moral education which my sainted, lamented
mother gave me, together with scientific studies,
serious philosophy, and continual occupation, have kept
me in what is commonly called the right path, and have
strengthened the horror that I feel for all tyranny,
whether it be styled man or temperament.</p>

<p>You accuse your biographer of having committed an
indignity in directing an accusation against a woman,
because this woman was your wife; do you not commit
an indignity yourself in insulting many others?</p>

<p>And if you blame those who calumniate the morals
of Proudhon because he is not of their opinion, in what
light do you think that men will regard your calumnious
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"> 68</a></span>
insinuations against women, because they do not
think like you?</p>

<p>You claim that we have no morality, because we lack
respect towards the dignity of others; who has set us
this detestable example more than you? You, who style
yourself the champion of the principles of '89&mdash;who
are the men and women whom you attack?</p>

<p>They who are in different degrees, and from different
stand points, in favor of these principles.</p>

<p>Your anger has no bounds against George Sand, our
great prose writer, the author of the bulletins of the republic
of '48. You depreciate Madame de Stäel, whom
you have not read, and who was in advance of most of
the masculine writers of her epoch.</p>

<p>Two scaffolds are erected, two women mount thereon:
Madame Roland and Marie Antoinette. I, a woman,
will not cast insult on the decapitated queen, dying
with dignity and courage; no, I bow before the
block, whatever head may lay on it, and wipe away my
tears. But, Marie Antoinette died the victim of the
faults that her princely education had caused her to commit
against the modern principles; while Madame Roland,
the chaste and noble wife, died for the revolution,
and died blessing it.</p>

<p>Whence comes it that you greet the queen with your
sympathies, while you have nought but words of blame
and contempt for the revolutionist? And the men that
belong to the great party of the future, how do you
style them?</p>

<p>The Girondins, <i>effeminate</i>;</p>

<p>Robespierre and his adherents, <i>eunuchs</i>;</p>

<p>The gentle Bernardin de St. Pierre, <i>effeminate</i>;</p>

<p>M. Legouvé and those who think like him concerning
the emancipation of women, <i>effeminate</i>;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"> 69</a></span>
M. de Girardin, <i>absurd</i>;</p>

<p><i>Béranger, a pitiable author, and effeminate</i>; Jean
Jacques, not only the prince of <i>effeminates</i>, but <i>the
greatest enemy of the people and the revolution</i>&mdash;he
who was evidently the chief author of our "French
Revolution."</p>

<p>Are we not justified in asking you, whether you are
for or against the Revolution?</p>

<p>M. Proudhon, you have forfeited your right to all
consideration, since you have none for those who have
neither offended you or offered you provocation, those
who have never pretended to reduce you to servitude;
men have lacked courage; they ought to have stopped
you when you began to descend to insulting personalities;
what they have not done, I, a woman, will do,
fearing nothing, or no one, except my own conscience.</p>

<p>Proudhon, the greatest enemy of the people, is the
writer who, treading under foot reason and conscience,
science and facts, calls to his aid all the ignorance, all
the despotism of the past, to mislead the spirit of the
people with respect to the rights of half the human
species.</p>

<p>Proudhon, the greatest enemy of the revolution, is he
who shows it to women as a toy; who detaches them
from its holy cause by confounding it with the negation
of their rights; who attacks and vilifies the advocates
of progress; who dares, in fine, in the name of the
principles of general emancipation, to proclaim the social
annihilation and the conjugal servitude of one entire
half of humanity.</p>

<p>Behold the enemy of the people and of the revolution!</p>

<p class="subh"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"> 70</a></span>
II.</p>

<p>I had proceeded thus far in my reply when, pausing
to take breath and to reflect, I grew calm.</p>

<p>What! said I to myself, have I then no more sense
than to take in earnest that shapeless thing honored by
the name of theory by the good people who are so bewildered
by the noise of Proudhon's drum and tam-tam
that they see stars at noon-day and the sun at midnight?
Let me be calm, let me not give to the affair
more importance than it possesses; and since I must set
forth this thing to my readers, let me do it in a fitting
tone. We will leave Proudhon to explain himself in
his own words.</p>

<p>No sooner had I taken this good resolution, than I
evoked M. Proudhon, and said to him in all humility:
Master, I come to you that you may define for me the
nature of woman, and also something of the nature of
man.</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> You do well, for I alone am capable of
instructing you; listen then to me.</p>

<p>"The complete human being, <i>adequate to his destiny</i>,
I speak of the physical, is the male, who, through
his virility, attains the highest degree of muscular and
nervous tension comporting with his nature and end, and
thence, the maximum of action in labor and in battle.</p>

<p>"Woman is a <span class="smallc">DIMINUTIVE</span> of man, lacking one organ
to become a pubescent youth.</p>

<p>"She is a <i>receptacle for the germs that man alone
produces</i>, a place of <i>incubation</i>, like the earth for the
seed of the wheat; an <i>organ inert</i> in itself, and purposeless
with respect to the woman. Such an organization&mdash;<i>presupposes
the subordination of the subject</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"> 71</a></span>
"In herself, I speak still of the physical, woman has
no reason to exist; <i>she is an instrument of reproduction</i>
which it has pleased nature to choose in preference to
any other.</p>

<p>"Woman, in this first count, is inferior to man: <i>a
sort of mean term between him and the rest of the animal
kingdom</i>."&mdash;<i>Justice</i>, Vol. III., etc.</p>

<p>And remark that I am not alone in my opinion:</p>

<p>"Woman is not only different from man," says Paracelsus,
"she is different because she is lesser, because
her sex constitutes for her one faculty less. Wherever
virility is wanting, the subject is imperfect; wherever it
is taken away, the subject deteriorates. Woman lacks
nothing in the physical point of view except <i>to produce
germs</i>.</p>

<p>"Likewise, in the intellectual point of view, woman
possesses perceptions, memory and imagination, she is
capable of attention, reflection, and judgment; what
does she lack?</p>

<p>"The power of producing germs, that is, ideas.&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>Now, follow my reasoning closely: It being admitted
that <i>strength has some weight in the establishment of
right</i>; it being admitted, on the other hand, that woman
is one third weaker than man, she will then be to
man, in physical respects, as two is to three. Consequently,
in the social workshop, the value of the products
of woman will be one third less than that of the
products of man; therefore, in the division of social advantages,
the proportion will be the same: <i>thus says
justice</i>.</p>

<p>"Man will always be stronger and will always produce
more," <i>which signifies that man will be the master,
and that woman will obey, dura lex, sed lex</i>."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"> 72</a></span>
Besides, reflect that woman falls to the charge of man
during gestation; her physical weakness, her infirmities,
her maternity, exclude her <i>inevitably</i> and <i>judicially</i> from
all political, doctrinal and industrial direction.&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>We will now proceed to the second point. But first,
mark well that woman, like all else, is autonomic; woman,
considered apart from the influence of man, is the
thesis; woman, considered under the influence of man,
is the antithesis; it is the thesis that we are now examining.
Let us therefore approach the <i>thetic</i> woman in
the intellectual relation.</p>

<p>We will first admit the principle that <i>thought is proportional
to force</i>; whence we have a right to conclude
that man possesses a stronger intellect than woman. Thus
we see man alone possessing genius. As to woman, she
is nothing in science; we owe to her no invention, <i>not
even her distaff and spindle</i>. She never <i>generalizes</i>,
never <i>synthetizes</i>; her mind is anti-metaphysical; <i>she
cannot produce any regular work, not even a romance</i>;
<i>she composes nothing but medleys, monsters</i>; "she
makes epigrams, satire; does not know how to express a
judgment in set terms, nor assign its causes; it was not
she who created abstract words, such as cause, time,
space, quantity, relation. <i>Woman is a true table rapping
medium.</i>"&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>I have already told you that woman does not produce
intellectual germs any more than physical germs; her
intellectual inferiority tells upon the quality of the product
as much as upon the intensity and duration of the
action and, as in this feeble nature, the defect of the
idea results from the lack of energy of the thought, it
may be truly said that woman possesses a mind <i>essentially</i>
false, of irremediable <i>falsity</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"> 73</a></span>
"Disconnected ideas, contradictory reasonings, chimeras
taken for realities, unreal analogies erected into
principles, a tendency of mind inclining inevitably
towards annihilation: such is the intellect of woman."</p>

<p>Yes, woman "<i>is a passive, enervating being, whose
conversation exhausts like her embraces. He who
wishes to preserve entire the strength of his mind and
body will flee her.</i>"&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Without man, who is to her prophet and word,
she would not emerge from the bestial condition.</i>"</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Calm yourself, Master, and tell me whether
it is true that you have dealt harshly with literary
women.</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> Literary women! As if there were
any! "The woman author does not exist; she is a
contradiction. The part of woman in literature is the
same as in manufactures; she is useful where genius is
no longer of service, like a needle or a bobbin.</p>

<p>"By cutting out of a woman's book all that is borrowed,
imitated, gleaned, and common-place, we reduce
it to a few pretty sayings; philosophy on nothing. To
the community of ideas, woman brings nothing of her
own, any more than to generation."</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> Ah! I understand: you mean that, in
the character of author, the woman of genius does not
exist. But in this respect, among the number of men
that write how many are there who have genius, and
who never borrow from any one?</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span>
I grant that there are many effeminate
men; which does not alter the fact that woman would
do better <i>to go and iron her collars</i> than to meddle with
writing; for, "it may be affirmed without fear of calumny,
that the woman who dabbles with philosophy
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"> 74</a></span>
and writing destroys her progeny by the labor of her
brain and her kisses which savor of man; the safest
and most honorable way for her is to renounce home
life and maternity; destiny has branded her on the
forehead; made only for love, the title of concubine if
not of courtesan suffices her."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>Let us now consider the <i>thetic</i> woman in the moral
point of view. We will admit in the first place the
principle <i>that virtue exists in the ratio of strength and
intellect</i>, whence we have a right to conclude that man
is more virtuous than woman. Do not laugh; it disturbs
my ideas. I go further; man alone is virtuous;
man alone has the sense of justice; man alone has the
comprehension of right. Tell me, I pray you, "what
produces in man this energy of will, this confidence in
himself, this frankness, this daring, all these powerful
qualities that we have agreed to designate by the single
word, morality. What inspires him with the sentiment
of his dignity, the scorn of falsehood, the hatred of injustice,
the abhorence of all tyranny? Nothing else
than the consciousness of his strength and reason."</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> But then, Master, if man is all this, why
do you reproach the men of our times with lack of courage,
of dignity, of justice, of reason, of good faith?
When I take up in minute detail the terrible charges
which you have fulminated against the masculine race,
I can make nothing of the meaning of the tirade you
have just uttered.</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> Consider what you irreverently name a
tirade, as the necessary check to feminine immorality.</p>

<p>It is only to set forth the truth that of all the differences
that separate her mind from ours, the conscience
of woman is the most trifling, her morality is of a different
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"> 75</a></span>
nature; what she regards as right and wrong is
not identically the same as what man himself regards as
right and wrong, so that, relatively to us, <i>woman may
be styled an immoral being</i>.</p>

<p>"<i>By her nature she is in a state of constant demoralization</i>,
always on this side or that of justice....
Justice is insupportable to her.... Her conscience is
anti-judicial."</p>

<p>She is aristocratic, loves privileges and distinctions;
"in all revolutions that have liberty and equality for
their object, women make the most resistance. They
did more harm in the revolution of February than all
the powers of the masculine reaction combined.</p>

<p>"Women have so little judicial sense that the legislator
who fixed the age of moral responsibility at sixteen
for both sexes, might have delayed it till forty-five,
for women. Woman's conscience is <i>decidedly of no value
till this age</i>."</p>

<p>In herself, woman is <i>immodest</i>.</p>

<p>It is from man therefore that she receives modesty,
"which is the product of manly dignity, the corollary
of justice.</p>

<p>"Woman has no other inclination, no other aptitude
than love.</p>

<p>"In affairs of love, the initiative belongs truly to woman."&mdash;<i>Justice</i>,
<i>Vol.</i> III., pp. 364, 366.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> How many persons you will astonish,
Master, by revealing to them that <i>modesty comes from
man</i>; that consequently all the young girls who have
been seduced, all the little girls whose corruptors and
violators are punished by the courts, are but jades,
who, through their initiative, have caused men to forget
their character as inspirers of chastity!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"> 76</a></span>
You enlighten me, illustrious Master; and I shall at
once draw up a memorial to demand that all seduced
and violated women and girls shall be punished as they
deserve; and that, to console the seducers, suborners,
corruptors and violators, poor innocent victims of feminine
ferocity, for having sinned against the <i>corollary of
justice and the product of manly dignity</i>, rose-trees
shall be forced to blossom, in order that the <i>maires</i> of
the forty thousand communes of France and Algeria
may crown them winners of the roses.</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> Jest as you please; woman is nevertheless
so perverse in her nature, that, through inclination,
she seeks men who are ugly, old, and wicked.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Is not this somewhat exaggerated, Master?</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> (Forgetting what he has just said,)</p>

<p>"Woman always prefers a pretty, finical puppet to
an honest man; a beau, a knave can obtain from her all
that he desires; she has nothing but disdain for the man
who is capable of sacrificing his love to his conscience."</p>

<p>You see what woman is: "<i>unproductive by nature,
inert, without industry or understanding, without justice,
and without modesty</i>, she needs that a father, a
brother, a lover, a husband, a master, a man, in fine,
should give her that magnetic influence, if I may thus
term it, which will render her capable of manly virtues,
of social and intellectual faculties."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>And as "all her philosophy, her religion, her politics,
her economy, her industry are resolved in one word:
Love;</p>

<p>"Now shall we make of this being belonging wholly
to love, an overseer, an engineer, a captain, a merchant,
a financier, an economist, an administrator, a scholar,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"> 77</a></span>
an artist, a professor, a philosopher, a legislator, a judge,
an orator, the general of an army, the head of a State?</p>

<p>"The question carries its answer within itself."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>I have laid down and proved my thesis, I am about to
draw my conclusions.</p>

<p>"Since in economical, political and social action, the
strength of the body and that of the mind concur and
are multiplied, the one by the other, the physical and
intellectual value of the man will be to the physical and
intellectual value of woman as 3 &#9747; 3 is to 2 &#9747; 2, or as
9 to 4.</p>

<p>"In the moral, as in the physical and intellectual
point of view, her value (that of woman,) is also as 2
to 3.</p>

<p>"Their share of influence, compared together, will be
as 3 &#9747; 3 &#9747; 3 is to 2 &#9747; 2 &#9747; 2 or as 27 to 8.</p>

<p>"According to these conditions, woman cannot pretend
to counterbalance the virile power; her subordination
is inevitable. Both by nature, and before justice,
she does not weigh the third of man."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>Do you understand clearly?</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Very clearly. Your theory, if theory
there be, is only a tissue of paradoxes; your pretended
principles <i>are contradicted by facts</i>, your conclusions
<i>are equally contradicted by facts</i>; you <i>affirm</i> like a revelator,
but you <i>never prove</i>, as a philosopher should do.
There is so much ignorance and senseless metaphysics
in all that you say, that I should rather give you credit
for bad faith than be compelled to despise you.</p>

<p>I have listened to you patiently while you have said
to me, in saying it of all women:</p>

<p>You are inert, passive, you possess the germ of nothing;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"> 78</a></span>
You are a mean term between man and beast, you
have no right to exist;</p>

<p>You are immoral, immodest, imbecile, aristocratic,
the enemy of liberty, equality and justice.</p>

<p>In your turn, endeavor to listen to me calmly, while
I refute your allegations by facts, by science and by reason.</p>

<p class="subh">III.</p>

<p>There is, by your own confession, but one good method
of demonstration; that of basing every affirmation
<i>upon well established facts, not contradicted by others,
legitimately deduced</i>.</p>

<p>Let us see how you have followed this method.</p>

<p>In order to prove that the <i>thetic</i> woman, or woman
considered apart from the influence of man, is such as
you depict her, it is necessary that you should bring us
face to face with an assemblage of such women, and afterwards,
with another assemblage composed of men
who have never been subjected to the influence of women,
that we may verify for ourselves the native activity
of the latter and the native inertness of the former.
Have you had at your disposal, can you place at ours
these proofs <i>de facto</i>?</p>

<p>No; and if you neither have them nor can procure
them, what is your thesis, if not the illusion of a brain
sick with pride and with hatred of woman?</p>

<p>1. You say: man alone produces physical germs.
Anatomy answers: <i>It is woman that produces the germ</i>;
the organ that performs this function in her, as in all
other females, is the ovary.</p>

<p>2. You say: woman is a diminutive of the man;
she is an imperfect male; anatomy says: <i>man and woman
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"> 79</a></span>
are two distinct beings, each one complete</i>, each
one furnished with a special organism, the one as necessary
as the other.</p>

<p>3. You say with Paracelsus, of whom this is not
the only absurdity: <i>where virility is wanting, the subject
is imperfect; where it is taken away, the subject
deteriorates</i>. Mere good sense replies: the being can
only be incomplete or deteriorate <i>when it differs from its
type</i>; now the type of woman is feminity not <i>masculinity</i>....
If, like you, I were a lover of paradox, I
would say: <i>man is an imperfect woman</i>, since it is the
woman that produces the germ; his part in reproduction
is very doubtful, and science may even learn some
day to dispense with it. This is Auguste Comte's paradox;
it is worth as much as yours.</p>

<p>To prove that woman is only an imperfect male, it is
necessary to establish by facts that man on being deprived
of virility, finds the organs developed in him peculiar
to woman, becomes qualified for conception, gestation,
delivery, and giving suck. Now I have never
learned that any keeper of a seraglio had been transformed
into an odahlic; have you?</p>

<p>4. You say: the organs peculiar to woman are inert,
and purposeless with respect to herself; physiology
answers: the labor that these organs accomplish is immense;
pregnancy and the crisis that terminates it are
incontestable proofs of this. The influence of these organs
makes itself felt, not only on the general health,
but in the intellectual and moral order. Pathology, no
less eloquent, depicts to us the grave disorders produced
among women by forced continence, incontinence, the
excessive or perverted vitality of these organs which you
pretend are inert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"> 80</a></span>
5. You say: woman is the soil, the place of incubation
for the germ. Anatomy has told you in reply
that the woman alone produces the germ. Read my reply
to your friend Michelet on the subject of the resemblance
of children and you will know what facts add to
the answer of science. Your affirmation is no less absurd
in the presence of these facts than that of a simpleton
who should pretend that the soil in which the
seed of the carnation or the oak is deposited, has the
property of causing rosebushes or palm trees to spring
up.</p>

<p>From this <i>false</i> supposition that woman has not physical
germs, you conclude that she is destitute of intellectual
and moral germs.... And do you really
dare accuse woman of thus <i>taking false analogies for
principles</i>?</p>

<p>Grant that when a man indulges in them thus wantonly,
and mistakes them for principles, we ought to be
more inclined to laugh than to be vexed.</p>

<p>6. You say that intellectually and morally, woman
is in herself, nothing.</p>

<p>Now, if I am not mistaken, you admit that our functions
have our organs for their basis, and you place the
functions of intellect and morality in the brain, according
to Gall, or similarly.</p>

<p>Well, Anatomy tells you: in both sexes, the cerebral
mass is similar in composition and, adds Phrenology, in
the number of organs. Biology adds: the law of development
of our organs is <i>exercise</i>, which supposes action
and reaction, the result of which is the augmentation
of the volume, consistency and vitality of the
organ exercised.</p>

<p>The point in question then, to convince your readers
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"> 81</a></span>
of the truth of your affirmations, is to prove that <i>the
two sexes are subjected to the same exercise of the brain
and to the same stimulus</i>, and that despite this identity
of education, woman constantly remains inferior. Have
you proved this? Have you ever thought of doing so?
No. For if you had, your theory would have fallen to
to the ground, since you would have been forced to acknowledge
that man and woman cannot be alike, for we
say to man from his infancy: resist, struggle;</p>

<p>To woman: yield, always submit.</p>

<p>To man: be yourself, speak your thoughts boldly,
ambition is a virtue; you can aspire to everything.</p>

<p>To woman: dissemble, calculate your slightest word,
respect prejudices; modesty, abnegation, such is your
lot; you can attain to naught.</p>

<p>To man: knowledge, talent, courage will open every
career of life to you, will make you honored by all.</p>

<p>To woman: knowledge is useless to you; if you
have it, you will pass for a pedant, and if you have
courage, you will be disdainfully called <i>virago</i>.</p>

<p>To man: for you are instituted lyceums, universities,
special schools, high prizes; all the institutions through
which your intellect can be developed; all the libraries
in which is accumulated the knowledge of the past.</p>

<p>To woman: for you is history in madrigals, the
reading of prayer-books and novels. You have nothing
to do with lyceums, special schools, high prizes, anything
that would elevate your mind and enlarge your
views; a learned woman is ridiculous!</p>

<p>Man must display the knowledge that he often possesses
but superficially, woman must hide what she
really possesses.</p>

<p>Man must appear courageous when he is often but a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"> 82</a></span>
coward; woman must feign timidity when in reality
she is not afraid.</p>

<p>For where man is reputed great and sublime, woman
is found ridiculous, sometimes odious.</p>

<p>If you had verified as you should have done, these
diametrically opposite systems of training, the one tending
to develop and ennoble the being, the other to degrade
it and render it imbecile, instead of writing such
absurdities, you would have said to yourself: woman
must really have the initiative to resist the iniquitous
system of repression that weighs upon her; she must
have great elasticity to show herself so often superior to
the majority of men in intellect, and <i>always in morality</i>.</p>

<p>I am curious to know what you males would be if
subjected to the same system as we. Look at those who
have not studied like you, and tell me whether they are
not in general beneath uncultivated women. Look then
at the men who have received a feminine education;
have they not all the affectation, all the narrowness of
mind of silly women?</p>

<p>Look, on the contrary, at those women who, through
the wish of their teachers or their own energy, have
been subjected to masculine discipline, and tell me, on
your conscience, whether they do not equal the most intelligent,
the firmest among you?</p>

<p>7. You say: intellectual force is in proportion to
physical force. <i>Facts</i> reply: great thoughts, useful
works, date from the period when the physical forces began
to decline. <i>Facts</i> say also: the athletic temperament,
which is the most vigorous, is <i>the least intellectual</i>:
statuaries fully comprehend this, and sculpture Hercules
with a large body and a small head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"> 83</a></span>
8. You say that morality is in a direct ratio to physical
and intellectual force combined. This pleasantry
we will not refute; every one knows too well that these
things have no relation, and that facts contradict your
assertion.</p>

<p>9. You say: woman being one third weaker, should
have in social labor one third the privileges of man.</p>

<p>Upon what elements do you base this proportion?
In order to establish it, did you carry a dynamometer
about through our districts and measure the strength of
each man and of each woman?</p>

<p>But were your affirmation true, is naught but <i>strength</i>
employed in labor? Then, great economist, what do
we do with <i>skill</i>? What Samsonian muscles are needed
to keep books, dispense justice, measure cloth, cut
and sew garments, etc.!</p>

<p>And what is the end of civilization if not to shift the
employ of our strength from ourselves to machinery that
we may be at liberty to use only our intellect and skill?</p>

<p>10. You say: the infirmities, the weaknesses, the
maternity of woman, and her aptitude for love, exclude
her from all functions; she is <i>judicially and absolutely</i>
excluded from all political, industrial and doctrinal direction.</p>

<p>She cannot be a political leader.... Yet history
shows us numerous empresses, queens, regents and sovereign
princesses who have governed with wisdom and
glory, and have shown themselves far superior to many
male sovereigns, unless Maria Theresa, Catherine II,
Isabella and Blanche of Castile, and many others, are
but myths.</p>

<p>Woman cannot be a legislator.... All the women
whom I have just cited have been so, and many more
beside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"> 84</a></span>
Women can be neither philosophers nor professors.</p>

<p>Hypatia, massacred by the Christians, taught Philosophy
with luster; in the Middle Age and later, Italian
women filled chairs of Philosophy, Law and Mathematics,
and excited admiration and enthusiasm; in
France, at the present time, the Polytechnists are making
great account of <i>the geometrician</i>, Sophie Germain,
who has taken it into her head to study Kant.</p>

<p>Woman cannot be a merchant or an administratrix...
Yet a great portion of the feminine population devote
themselves to trade, or fill commercial positions. It is
even admitted that the prosperity of commercial establishments
is almost always due to the administrative genius
of woman.</p>

<p>Woman cannot be an overseer, a foreman of a workshop...
Yet a host of women superintend workshops,
invent, improve, carry on manufactures alone,
and contribute, by their taste and activity, to the increase
of the national wealth and the industrial reputation
of France.</p>

<p>Woman cannot be artist... Yet every one knows
that the greatest literary artist of our age is a woman,
George Sand; yet every one bows before Duchesnois,
Mars, Georges, Maxime, Ristori, Rachel, Dorval; yet
every one pauses before the beautiful paintings of Rosa
Bonheur; yet since the revival of the fine arts, every
century has registered many celebrated women.</p>

<p>We meet women everywhere, working everywhere,
competing with man.... Yet Proudhon pretends
that she can be nowhere, that she is excluded from
every place absolutely and <i>judicially</i>; that if she governs
and legislates like Maria Theresa, it is a contradiction;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"> 85</a></span>
That if she philosophises like Hypatia, it is a contradiction;</p>

<p>That if she commands an army and wins victories
like the wife of the conqueror of Calais; if she fights
like Jeanne d'Arc, Jeanne Hachette, Madame Garibaldi
and thousands of others, it is a contradiction;</p>

<p>That if she is merchant, administratrix, superintendent
of a workshop, like thousands of women, it is a
contradiction;</p>

<p>That if she is learned like Dr. Boivin, Sophie Germain,
and many others, if she is a professor as are many
among us, it is a contradiction.</p>

<p>The thesis sustained by Proudhon is, as we have just
seen, contradicted by <i>science</i> and by <i>facts</i>. We ask
ourselves whether it is possible that he is ignorant of the
simplest notions of Anatomy and Biology; we ask ourselves
whether it is possible that he is so far blind as not
to see that woman <i>is in reality</i> all that he pretends that
she <i>absolutely and judicially</i> cannot be in his absurd
and insulting theory; and we conclude that the author
is struck with ignorance and voluntary blindness.</p>

<p>Your reproaches are pleasant; from the origin of society,
man has been the master; now, the ancient world
sunk beneath the weight of slavery, usury, and the most
shameless vices; the modern world seems doomed to
perish through inequality and its sad consequences, you
yourself acknowledge that injustice <i>caused by your sex</i>
exists every where in the world, and you say that man
has judicial sense!</p>

<p>And, in the face of the inequality and oppression
created by men, of their love of puerile distinctions, of
the base deeds which they commit for a bit of ribbon,
you accuse women of loving inequality and privileges!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"> 86</a></span>
They may love them, <i>like you</i>, but they are better
than you, if not more just; they pray for the vanquished,
you kill him!</p>

<p>I do not deny that women did much harm to the
Revolution of February, for they are as intelligent as
men, and have great influence over them. But what
did this Revolution do for them, I pray?</p>

<p>Mark me well, you and all those who are blind
enough, proud enough, despotic enough to resemble you,
and remember what I say.</p>

<p>Woman is like the people: she desires no more of
your revolutions, which decimate us for the benefit of a
few ambitious babblers.</p>

<p>She will have liberty and equality for all men and
women, or she will take care that no one shall have
them.</p>

<p>We, Women of Progress, openly declare ourselves
adversaries of whoever shall deny the right of woman
to liberty.</p>

<p>Our sisters of the people, indignant at their exclusion
from the popular assemblies, say to you: you have lured
us long enough, it is time that this should end. We
will no longer suffer ourselves to be ensnared by your
high-sounding words of Justice, Liberty, and Equality,
which are only false coin so long as they are applied to
but half the human species. Do you wish to save the
perishing world? Call woman to your side. If you
will not do this, let us alone, insipid phraseologists;
you are naught but ambitious hypocrites; we do not
wish our husbands to follow you, and they will not.</p>

IV.</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> Let us consider woman in the antithesis.
I have said that woman, considered apart from
masculine influence, is <i>nothing</i>.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Yes, Master, because this is a pure creation
of your thought.</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> But woman, considered under the influence
of man, is half of the human being, and <i>I sing litanies
in her praise</i>.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Then you make woman re-enter humanity
through the door of Androgyny, in order to restore to
her her share of rights.... This is absurd; no matter.</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> Not so! not so! Women have rights!
Never, so long as I am Proudhon! She is indeed the
complement of man, who, without her, would be only
a brute.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Ah! my learned Master, how do these
things harmonize in your brain? You have said hitherto
that <i>woman owes everything to man</i>, you tell me
now that, without woman, man would be only a brute.
Is he not then, <i>adequate to his destiny</i>, as you have affirmed?
And if woman is nothing without him, and he
nothing without woman, I can see no longer upon what
you rest in making him the guide of this poor unfortunate.</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> I need not explain myself, such is my
idea. I am simply comparing the respective qualities of
the sexes, and, as I find, they are <i>incommutable</i>.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Ah! I catch a glimpse of your meaning;
then you do not weigh them in the balance since
they are not alike, and, being unable to prejudice the
rights of woman, you leave her free.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"> 88</a></span>
<span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span>What! what! Woman free! Horrible!
Are you resolved to throw me into convulsions?
Woman, however eminent may be her talents, should
serve man in silence and in all humility.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Frankly, Master, all this appears to me
nonsense, which, satanic as you are, you cannot yourself
understand in the least.</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> Listen without interrupting me further,
if you wish to comprehend me.</p>

<p>"Without feminine grace, <i>man would not have
emerged from the brutality of the early ages; he would
violate his female, smother his little ones, and give
chase to his fellows in order to devour them</i>.</p>

<p>"<i>Woman is the conscience of man personified</i>, the
incarnation of his youth, <i>his reason and his justice, of
all within him that is purest, most sacred, most sublime</i>.&mdash;<i>Justice</i>,
<i>Vol.</i> III., etc.</p>

<p>"The ideality of his being, she becomes to him a
<i>principle of animation</i>, a gift of strength, of prudence,
of justice, of patience, of courage, of sanctity, of hope,
of consolation, without which he would be incapable of
sustaining the burden of life, of preserving his dignity,
of enduring himself, <i>of fulfilling his destiny</i>.</p>

<p>"It is through her, through the grace of her divine
word, that man gives life and reality to his ideas, by
bringing them back unceasingly from the abstract to the
concrete.</p>

<p>"<i>The auxiliary on the side of justice</i>, she is the angel
of patience, of resignation, of tolerance, the guardian
of his faith, the mirror of his conscience, the source
of his devotion. Vanquished, guilty, it is still in the
bosom of woman that he finds consolation and pardon."</p>

<p>Man has strength, woman beauty. Through her
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"> 89</a></span>
beauty, she should be the expression of Justice, "and
the attraction that draws us to it.... <i>She will be
better than man</i>.... She will be the motor of all
justice, all knowledge, all industry, all virtue."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>Also, "beauty is the true destination of the sex; it
is its natural condition, its state."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>Woman is the soul of everything; "without her, all
beauty fades; nature is sad, precious stones lose their
luster, all our arts, children of love, become insipid,
half of our labor is without value.</p>

<p>"If, with respect to vigor, man is to woman as 3 to
2, woman, with respect to beauty, is to man as 3 to 2.</p>

<p>"If, from the body, we pass to the mind and conscience,
woman, through her beauty, will be revealed
with new advantages."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>The mind of woman is <i>more intuitive, more concrete,
finer than that of man</i>; "it seems to man, and is in fact,
more circumspect, more <i>prudent</i>, more reserved, <i>wiser</i>,
more equable; it was <i>Minerva</i>, the protectress of Achilles
and Ulysses, who appeased the fury of the one, <i>and
shamed the other of his paradoxes and profligacies</i>; it
is the Virgin whom the Christian litany calls <i>the seat
of wisdom</i>.</p>

<p>"The quality of the feminine mind has the effect of
serving the genius of man as a radiator, by reflecting
his thoughts at an angle which makes them appear more
beautiful if they are correct, more absurd if they are
false; consequently, of simplifying our knowledge and
condensing it into simple propositions, easy to seize upon
as simple facts, and the intuitive, aphoristic, imaged
comprehension of which, <i>while giving woman a share
in the philosophy and the speculations of man</i>, makes
their memory clearer to him, their digestion more easy...
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"> 90</a></span>
<i>There is not a man among the most learned, the
most inventive, the most profound, who does not feel a
sort of refreshment from conversation with women</i>....</p>

<p>"Popularizers are generally minds of the feminine
type; but man does not like to be subservient to the
glory of man, and provident Nature has assigned this
part to woman.</p>

<p>"Let her speak, then, <i>let her write, even, I authorize
and invite her to do so</i>; but let her do it according to
the measure of her feminine intelligence, since it is on
this condition that she can serve us, and <i>please</i> us,
<i>otherwise I withdraw the permission</i>.</p>

<p>"Man has strength; but that constancy of which he
boasts overmuch, he derives especially from woman....
Through her he endures, and learns true heroism.
<i>Upon occasion, she can set him the example of it</i>;
she will be, then, <i>more sublime than he</i>.</p>

<p>"Woman will render the law kind, and will convert
this two-edged sword into an olive branch.... There
is no justice without tolerance; now, it is in the exercise
of tolerance that woman excels; by the sensibility
of her heart and the delicacy of her impressions, by the
tenderness of her soul, by her love, in fine, she will
blunt the sharp angles of justice, destroy its asperities,
of a divinity of terror make a divinity of peace. Justice,
the mother of Peace, would be only a cause of disunion
to humanity, were it not for this tempering which
she receives especially from woman."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>And what chastity does woman possess! With what
constancy she awaits her betrothed! What continence
she observes during the absence or sickness of her husband!
Ah! "woman alone knows how to be modest....
Through this modesty, which is her most precious
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"> 91</a></span>
prerogative, she triumphs over the transports of man,
and ravishes his heart."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>And what wisdom in her choice of the companion of
her life!</p>

<p>"She desires man to be strong, valiant, ingenious;
she turns from him if he is mincing and delicate."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>Now, my unloved, indocile, and very irreverent disciple,
let us recapitulate.</p>

<p>Woman, with respect to physical, intellectual and
moral beauty, is to man as 3 to 2; "thus it may be
said, indeed, that between man and woman there exists
a certain equivalence, arising from their respective comparison,
in the two-fold point of view of strength and
beauty; if, by labor, genius, and justice, man is to woman
as 27 to 8, in her turn, by graces of form and
mind, by amenity of character and tenderness of heart,
she is to man as 27 to 8.... But these respective
qualities are incommutable, cannot be the subject of
any contract....</p>

<p>"Now, as every question of preponderance in the
government of human life is within the jurisdiction
either of the economical order, or of the philosophical or
judicial order, it is evident that superiority of beauty,
even of that which is intellectual and moral, cannot create
a compensation for woman, whose condition is thus
made fatally subordinate."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>Do you understand me now?</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> I understand that this is pure sophistry, a
thing easily demonstrated; that if your <i>thesis</i> is absurd,
your <i>antithesis</i>, however complimentary it may be, is
quite as much so; that you have piled contradictions
upon contradictions, and that it is a sad spectacle to me
to see so strong and fine an intellect as yours abandon
itself to such practices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"> 92</a></span>
You shall judge for yourself whether my reproaches
and regrets are well founded.</p>

<p>In the <i>Thesis</i> you say: man alone is in himself intelligent
and just, he alone is adequate to his destiny.
Woman has no reason for existing; without man, she
<i>would not emerge from the bestial condition</i>.</p>

<p>In the <i>Antithesis</i>: without woman, who is the principle
of animation of man, the motive power of all science,
of all art, of all industry, of all virtue&mdash;without
woman, who renders justice possible, thought comprehensible
and applicable, man, far from being in himself
just, intelligent, a worker, would be but a brute, <i>who
would violate his female, strangle his little ones, and
pursue his fellow men in order to devour them</i>.</p>

<p>What follows from these divergent affirmations?
That if woman alone is inadequate to her destiny, man
alone is inadequate to his, and that the adequateness of
both is caused by the synthesis of their respective qualities.</p>

<p>It also follows, by your own admission, that man
receives as much from woman as she receives from him,
since, if he rescues her from the bestial state, she rescues
him from the state of brute ferocity.</p>

<p>It follows, lastly, by your own admission, that there
is equivalence between the respective qualities of the
two sexes. Only you pretend that these qualities cannot
be measured by each other, and cannot therefore
be subject for contract, and that the qualities of
man being more important to the social state than those
of woman, the latter should be subordinated to the
former.</p>

<p>Tell me, is there commutability between the qualities
that distinguish men from each other?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"> 93</a></span>
Between the man of genius and the humble rag-picker?</p>

<p>Between the philosopher who elevates the human
mind and the porter who does not even know how to
read?</p>

<p>Between the brain that discovers a great natural
law and the one that reflects on nothing?</p>

<p>To answer affirmatively is impossible: for we only
compare things of the same nature.</p>

<p>Now, if there can be no commutability between individuals
so different, is there not, according to your system,
subject for social contract between them?</p>

<p>Why then do you claim that these men should be
<i>equal socially</i>?</p>

<p>Why then do you admit that they may associate
things in a private contract which cannot be subjected
to a common measure?</p>

<p>There is no need to be learned in philosophy or economy
to know <i>that any contract whatsoever is an admission
of personal insufficiency</i>; that we would not enter
into partnership with others if we could dispense with
them; and that in general the design of the contracting
parties is <i>to establish commutability where it has not
been established by the nature of things</i>.</p>

<p>To a common work, one brings his idea, another his
hands, a third, his money, a fourth, custom: if each of
the parties had had all these combined, no one would
have thought of forming a partnership: a happy insufficiency
brought them together, and caused them to
establish equivalence between the shares of capital which
could not be subjected to a common measure.</p>

<p>Were it true, therefore, that the qualities of the sexes
differ as you pretend, then, as through this same difference,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"> 94</a></span>
they are <i>equally</i> necessary to the collective work,
they are <i>essentially</i> subject to contract, and <i>equivalent</i>.</p>

<p>But do they differ as you say? You know the answer
of <i>science</i> and <i>facts</i>. We will not return to it.
All your distinctions of beauty and strength are only
imaginary classifications. We all know that of eighteen
millions of Frenchmen, at the present time, we have a
few men of genius, absorbed in specialties, a few more
men of talent, perhaps not four philosophers, mediocrities
in abundance, and an immense host of cyphers. It
is mockery, therefore, to establish the right of prepotency
of a sex from qualities which, on the one hand,
do not exist in each of its members, and, on the other,
are often found in the highest degree in the sex which
it is claimed to reduce to subjection.</p>

<p>Besides, did your sex possess the qualities which you
ascribe to it, to the exclusion of mine; since, by your
admission, there would be neither civilization, nor science,
nor art, nor justice, without the qualities you
term peculiar to woman; and since, without these qualities,
man would be only a brute and an anthropophagus,
it thence follows that woman is <i>at least</i> the equivalent of
man, if not his superior.</p>

<p>Let us now notice a few of your contradictions.</p>

<p>1st <i>Thesis</i>. Woman is a sort of mean term between
man and the rest of the animal kingdom.</p>

<p><i>Antithesis.</i> No; woman is the idealisation of man,
in that which is purest and most sublime in him.</p>

<p>2d <i>Thesis</i>. Woman is an inert creature, devoid of
understanding, that has no reason for existing.</p>

<p><i>Antithesis.</i> No; woman is the animating principle
of man; without her, he could not fulfil his destiny;
she is the motive power of all justice, all science, all
industry, all civilization, all virtue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"> 95</a></span>
3d <i>Thesis</i>. Woman does not know how to express
an opinion in set terms, or to assign reasons for it; she
has only disconnected ideas, erroneous reasonings; she
mistakes chimeras for realities, composes nothing but
medleys, monsters.</p>

<p><i>Antithesis.</i> No; the intellect of woman is finer than
that of man; she has a wiser, more prudent, more reserved
mind; she is the foil of masculine ideas. She is
Minerva shaming Ulysses for his paradoxes and profligacies;
she is the seat of wisdom.</p>

<p>4th <i>Thesis</i>. Without the magnetic influence of man,
woman would not emerge from the bestial state.</p>

<p><i>Antithesis.</i> Without the magnetic influence of woman,
man would be but a ferocious beast.</p>

<p>5th <i>Thesis</i>. The woman who philosophises and
writes, destroys her progeny; she had better go iron
her collars; she is good for nothing but to be concubine
or courtesan.</p>

<p><i>Antithesis.</i> Woman should participate in the philosophy
and speculations of man, and popularize them by
her writings.</p>

<p>6th <i>Thesis</i>. The conversation of woman exhausts,
enervates; he who wishes to preserve intact the force
of his mind and body, will flee her.</p>

<p><i>Antithesis.</i> The conversation of woman refreshes
the most eminent men.</p>

<p>7th <i>Thesis</i>. Woman has an infirm conscience; she
is immoral, anti-judicial; she is worth nothing as to
moral responsibility until forty-five years of age.</p>

<p><i>Antithesis.</i> Woman is the mirror of the conscience
of man, the incarnation of this conscience; through her
alone justice becomes possible; she is the guardian of
morals; she is superior to man in moral beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"> 96</a></span>
8th <i>Thesis</i>. Woman is without virtue.</p>

<p><i>Antithesis.</i> Woman excels in tolerance; through
her, man learns constancy and true heroism.</p>

<p>9th <i>Thesis</i>. Woman is immodest: she takes the
initiative in affairs of love.</p>

<p><i>Antithesis.</i> Woman alone knows how to be modest;
in principle, there are no impure women; woman calms
the sensual passions of man.</p>

<p>10th <i>Thesis</i>. Woman prefers an ugly, old, and
wicked man.</p>

<p>No; woman prefers a pretty, mincing puppet, a beau.</p>

<p><i>Antithesis.</i> No; woman wishes man strong, valiant,
ingenious; she turns from him when he is but a pretty,
mincing puppet, a beau.</p>

<p>I might go on thus to a hundred, and then make a
cross to begin another hundred. Can it be possible
that you trifle in this manner with your readers?</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> The contradiction is not in my thought,
but only in the terms. The woman of my thesis is she
who has not been subjected to masculine magnetism, to
which the woman of my antithesis, on the contrary, has
been subjected.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> You would have reason to laugh at us,
should we take such an answer in earnest. What! have
you seen women outside of society, who would have
taken men for monkeys?</p>

<p>Have you proved that in this menagerie, they think
falsely, they write badly, they are worth nothing as to
conscience until forty-five years of age?</p>

<p>That there, in the absence of men, the women take
the initiative in affairs of love?</p>

<p>That the conversation of these women exhausts, enervates
the men who are not there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"> 97</a></span>
That these women prefer the old, ugly and wicked
men, or the pretty, mincing puppets, who are not at
their disposal?</p>

<p>If the woman of your thesis is the one who has not
been subjected to masculine influence, why do you take
the women whom you attack from among those who
have been subjected to it?</p>

<p>Your contradictions, Master, are genuine and fair
contradictions. For you as for us, there is but one woman:
she who lives in the society of man, who has,
like him, faults and vices, and who influences him as
much as she is influenced by him: the other has never
existed except in the brain of mystics and of victims of
hallucination.</p>

<p>But we will leave this.</p>

<p>I have been told that you have spoken of love: it
would seem to me impossible, did I not know your
audacity.</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> I have spoken of it, as well as of Marriage.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Well! let us make a little excursion into
these two territories. We will first speak of Love.</p>

<p class="subh">V.</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> Love!... It wearies and annoys me
greatly. I have never yet been able to make my ideas
agree on this subject.</p>

<p>I at first defined love: "the attraction of the two
sexes towards each other with a view to reproduction,"
adding that this attraction becomes purified by the adjunction
of the Ideal. I even made a most beautiful
discovery with respect to this, namely: that there is a
sexual division because it is impossible to idealize anything
but the objective.&mdash;<i>Vol.</i> III.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"> 98</a></span>
<span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> How you run on! Then all of the animal
and vegetable species in which the sexes are separated
have an ideal in love? An ideal in the brain of
a horse or a mare may pass, since there is a brain; but
where will you lodge that of the male and female flower?</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> On my honor, I never thought of asking
myself that question. We will return, if you
please, to the definition of human love. I say, then,
that love is an attraction given with a view to reproduction;
notwithstanding, I think, also, that to love,
properly called, progeny is odious.&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> But this is a contradiction...</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> Am I to blame for that! You know,
that in my eyes, man and woman form <i>the organ of
justice, the humanitary Androgynus</i>. Now I affirm
that love is the moving power of justice, because it is
this that attracts towards each other the two halves of
the couple. It is through love, therefore, that the conscience
of man and woman is opened to the knowledge
of justice, which does not hinder it from being "the
most powerful fatality by which nature could have
found the secret of obscuring reason within us, of afflicting
the conscience, and of chaining the free will."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> The moving power of justice, the sentiment
which opens the conscience of the sexes to justice,
and which forms the judicial organ, disturbs the reason
and afflicts the conscience! But this is a contradiction.</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> Once more, am I to blame for it?
Love, sought for itself, renders man unworthy, and woman
vile; and stop! "love, even when sanctioned by
justice, I do not like."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Have you not said that without the love
inspired in man by the beauty of woman, there would
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"> 99</a></span>
be neither art, nor science, nor industry, nor justice;
that man would be only a brute?</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> Ah! I have said much more!...
This love, the motor of justice, the father of civilization,
is, notwithstanding, <i>the abolition of justice</i>, which
exacts that it should be cast aside as soon as its office of
motor is performed. The impulse, the movement given,
it must be dispensed with. In marriage, it should play
the smallest part possible; "all amorous conversation,
even between betrothed lovers, even between husband
and wife, is indecorous, destructive of domestic respect,
of the love of labor and the practice of social duty." A
marriage of pure inclination is nearly allied to shame,
and "the father that gives his consent to it is deserving
of censure."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> A father deserving of censure because he
unites those who yield to the motive power of justice!</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> Let young people marry without repugnance,
that is right.... But "when a son, a daughter,
to satisfy inclination, tramples under foot the wishes
of the father, disinheritance is his first right and most
sacred duty."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Thus love, the motor of justice, the cause
of civilization, the necessity for reproduction, is at the
same time a thing of shame which should be feared and
banished from marriage, and that, in certain cases, deserves
disinheritance!... May the gods bless your
contradictions, and posterity pass lightly over them!</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> I can say nothing more satisfactory on
the subject; but, let us talk of marriage; I am strong
indeed on that point.</p>

<p>Every function supposes an organ; man is the organ
of liberty; but justice exacts an organ composed of two
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"> 100</a></span>
terms: the couple. It is necessary that the two persons
that compose it should be dissimilar and unequal, "because,
if they were alike, they would not be completed
by each other; they would be two beings wholly independent,
without reciprocal action, incapable, through
this cause, to produce justice.... In principle, there
is no difference between man and woman, except a simple
diminution of energy in their faculties.</p>

<p>"Man is stronger, woman is weaker, that is all....
Man is the power of that of which woman is the ideal,
and reciprocally, woman is the ideal of that of which
man is the power."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>Androgyny laid down, I define marriage to be: "the
sacrament of justice, the living mystery of universal
harmony; the form given by nature itself to the religion
of the human race. In a lower sphere, marriage
is the act by which man and woman, elevating themselves
above love and the senses, declare their wish to
be united according to the law, and, as far as in them
lies, to pursue the social destiny, by laboring for the
Progress of Justice.</p>

<p>"In this family religion, it may be said that the father
is the priest, the wife the god, the children the people....
<i>All are in the hands of the father</i>, fed by his
labor, protected by his sword, subjected to his government,
<i>within the jurisdiction of his court</i>, heirs and
continuers of his thought.... <i>Woman remains subordinate
to man</i>, because she is an object of worship, and
because there is no common measure between the force
and the ideal.... Man will die for her, as he dies for
his faith and his gods, but he will keep for himself the
command and the responsibility."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>In result, the spouses are equal, since there is community
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"> 101</a></span>
of fortune, of honor, of absolute devotion; "<i>in
principle and practice</i> ... this equality does not exist,
<i>cannot exist</i>.... The equality of rights supposing an
equilibrium between the advantages with which Nature
has endowed woman and the more powerful faculties of
man, the result would be that woman, instead of being
elevated by this equilibrium, would be denaturalized,
debased. By the ideality of her being, woman is, so to
speak, beyond price.... That she may preserve this
inestimable charm, which is not a positive faculty in her,
but a quality, a manner, a state, she must accept the
law of marital power: <i>equality would render her odious</i>,
would be the dissolution of marriage, the death of
love, <i>the destruction of the human race</i>.</p>

<p>"And the glory of man consists in reigning over this
admirable creature, in being able to say: she is myself
idealized, she is more than I, and, notwithstanding,
would be nothing without me.... In spite of this or
on account of this, I am and ought to remain the head
of the community; if I yield the command to her, she
becomes debased and we perish."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>Marriage should be monogamous, "because conscience
is common between the spouses, and because it
cannot, without being dissolved, admit a third participant."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>It should be indissoluble, because conscience is immutable,
and the spouses could not procure an exchange
<i>without being guilty of sacrilege</i>. If they are obliged
to separate, "the deserving one needs only to heal the
wounds made in his heart and conscience, the other has
no longer the right to aspire to marriage, but must be
content with concubinage."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>What do you think of this theory?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"> 102</a></span>
<span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Hitherto I have refused to believe in the
god Proteus; but on contemplating you, Master, I abjure
my incredulity.</p>

<p>You appear to us first under the garb and form of
Manou, and we discuss his physiology;</p>

<p>You appear to us next, successively, in the shape and
vestments of Moses, St. Thomas Aquinas, and St. Bonaventure;
you are incarnated for a moment in Paracelsus;</p>

<p>Lastly, you put on the Roman toga, over which you
wrap the ungraceful robe of Auguste Comte.</p>

<p>All this is too old, too unsightly for our age....
Have you really nothing better to give us than the
resurrection of the Roman law at the glorious time when
Cincinnatus ate his dish of lentils stark naked?</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> What! do you dispute that marriage
by <i>confarreation is not the masterpiece of the human
conscience</i>?</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Do I dispute it? Yes, indeed, and many
other things beside. But tell me, what meaning do you
give to the words <i>sacrament</i> and <i>mystery</i>, that sound so
hollow and false from your lips?</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> Despite all my explanations concerning
marriage, there nevertheless remains a mystery with
respect to it. This is all I can tell you in elucidation.
You must comprehend that "marriage is an institution
<i>sui generis</i>, formed at the same time at the tribunal of
human justice by contract, and at the spiritual tribunal
by sacrament, and which perishes as soon as the one or
the other of these two elements disappears."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>You must also comprehend that "marriage is a function
of humanity, outside of which love becomes a
scourge, the distinction of the sexes has no longer any
meaning, the perpetuation of the species becomes a real
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"> 103</a></span>
injury to the living, <i>justice is contrary to nature and
the plan of the creation is absurd</i>."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> The plan of the creation absurd, and justice
contrary to nature without marriage! What does
this mean in plain language?</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> What! Is your intellect so feeble that
it does not comprehend that, without marriage, there is
not, there cannot be justice?</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Then marriage is necessary to all?</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> No; but "all participate in it and receive
its influence through filiation, consanguinity, adoption
which, universal in its essence, in order to act, has
no need of cohabitation.... In the animic or spiritual
point of view, marriage is to each of us a condition of
felicity.... Every adult, healthy in mind and body,
whom solitude or abstraction has not sequestered from
the rest of mankind, loves, and by virtue of this love,
contracts marriage in his heart.... Justice, which is
the end of love, and which can be obtained either by
domestic initiation, by civic communion, or, lastly, by
mystical love," suffices "for happiness in every condition
of age and fortune."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>And do not confound marriage with any other union,
with concubinage, for example, "which is the mark of
a feeble conscience." I do not however condemn the
concubinary, for "society is not the work of a day, virtue
is difficult to practise, without speaking of those to
whom marriage is <i>inaccessible</i>."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>In my opinion, it is for the interest of woman, of
children, and of morals, that concubinage should be
regulated by legislation. Every child should bear the
name of the concubinary father, who should provide for
his subsistence and for the expenses of his education;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"> 104</a></span>
"the forsaken concubine should also have a right to an
indemnity, unless she has been the first to enter into
another concubinage."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>But it is not from concubinage, but from marriage
that all justice, all right proceeds. This is so true,
that if you "take away marriage, the mother is left
with her tenderness, but without authority, without
rights: <i>she can no longer do justice to her son</i>; there
is illegitimacy, a first step backward, a return to immorality."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> All that you have just said concerning
love, marriage, justice and right, contains so many
equivocations, errors, sophisms, and so much pathos,
that nothing less than a huge volume would suffice to
refute, after first explaining you. We will content
ourselves, therefore, with dwelling on the principal
points.</p>

<p class="subh">VI.</p>

<p>1. The Androgynus, by definition, is a being combining
the two sexes. Now marriage does not make of
man and woman <i>a single being</i>; each preserves his individuality;
your humanitary Androgynus is not therefore
worth the trouble of discussion; it is only a fantasy.</p>

<p>2. Every organ supposes a function, it is true, but
what <i>facts</i> authorize you to say that the married couple
is the organ of justice? Especially when you take the
trouble to contradict yourself, in admitting that justice
is produced outside of marriage; that there is no need
of being married to be just?</p>

<p>The organ of justice, like all other organs, is in
each of us; it is the moral sense which comes into action
when the point in question is the appreciation of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"> 105</a></span>
moral value of an act, or to apply to our own conduct
the moral science accepted by the reason of the age.</p>

<p>3. According to you, equilibrium is <i>equality</i>; <i>equality
is justice</i>: there is, therefore, a contradiction on your
part in exacting of two beings, endowed each with liberty,
will and intellect, that they should acknowledge
themselves <i>unequal</i> to produce <i>equality</i>.</p>

<p>4. To affirm, as you have done, that progress is the
realization of the ideal through free will; that, consequently,
the ideal is superior to the reality, and that
man progresses because he suffers himself to be guided
by it; then to affirm that woman is the ideal of man
and that, notwithstanding, she is <i>less</i> and should <i>obey</i>,
is a double contradiction. If the point from which you
start be admitted, logic would exact that man should
permit himself to be guided by woman. But what is
the use of discussing a thing that is devoid of meaning
to the intellect? If man, according to you, represents
in reality strength, reason, justice, woman being the
idealization of man, would therefore represent the greatest
strength, the loftiest reason, the most sublime justice....
Do you pretend to say this, you who affirm the
contrary?</p>

<p>5. To say that marriage is an institution <i>sui generis</i>,
a <i>sacrament</i>, a <i>mystery</i>, is to affirm what? And what
enlightenment do you fancy that you have given us?
Are you fully sure of comprehending yourself better
than we comprehend you? I doubt it.</p>

<p>6. Can you demonstrate why, in an association between
strong, intelligent men, and weak, narrow-minded
men, justice exacts <i>equality</i>, respect for the dignity of
all, and declares the slave <i>debased</i> who submits; whilst
in the association of man and woman, <i>identical in species</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"> 106</a></span>
according to you, the woman who is always, according
to you, the weak and narrow-minded being,
would be <i>debased</i> and would become <i>odious</i> by equality?</p>

<p>7. Can you explain also how, in a couple which stands
for the producer of justice or equality, this equality
<i>would be the death of love and the destruction of the
human race</i>?</p>

<p>Grant that such a farrago of nonsense and contradictions
presents as many unfathomable <i>mysteries</i> as your
marriage.</p>

<p>We will say nothing of divorce: we leave it to modern
reason and conscience whether the dissolution of
morals and of the family, due in a great measure to the
indissolubility of marriage, does not give cause that it
should be granted. What reasons do you give, besides,
to support your opinions? An absurdity: that the rupture
of marriage is <i>sacrilege</i>; an affirmation contradicted
by facts: that conscience is immutable.</p>

<p>8. Between the bastard and his mother, there is no
justice, say you. Your conscience is younger by two
thousand and some hundred years than the modern conscience.
In the work of reproduction, the task to be
performed with reference to the new being, is divided
between the parents. On the woman, as the more vital,
more elastic, and more resisting, devolves the more perilous
part of this task. You shall risk your life to form
humanity from your own substance, says Nature to her.
To the man it belongs to pay his debt to his children
by erecting the roof under which they take shelter, by
bringing the food which you elaborate or prepare for
them. To him it belongs to accomplish his duty towards
his sons by the use of his strength, as you accomplish
yours by supplying them with your blood and your milk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"> 107</a></span>
Your rights over the child arise, adds conscience,
from his incapacity to take care of himself, from the
duties which you fulfil towards him, from the obligation
under which you are placed to form his reason
and conscience, and to make him a useful and moral
citizen.</p>

<p>Well, what happens most of the time, in cases of illegitimacy?
That the father having weakly, cruelly, contrary
to all justice, deserted his task, the mother performs
double duty towards her children: <i>she is at once
father and mother</i>.</p>

<p>And it is when this mother has a <i>double</i> right that
you dare to say that she has <i>none</i>! that between her
and her son there is no justice! In truth, I should
rather live among savages than in a society that thinks
and <i>feels</i> like you.</p>

<p>A mother has an incontestable right over her child,
for she has risked her own life to give it birth: the
father acquires rights over it only when ever he fulfils
his duty; when he does not fulfil it, he has no right;
thus says reason. In this question, marriage signifies
nothing. If I were illegitimate, and my father had
basely abandoned me, I should despise and hate him as
the executioner of my mother; as a man without heart
and conscience, a vile egotist; and I should doubly love
and respect her who had been at once my mother and
my father. Such are the dictates of my conscience, my
reason, and my heart.</p>

<p>9. What is your marriage, <i>the first form given by
Nature to the religion of the human race</i>, in which woman
is an idol who does the cooking and mends the
stockings of her priest?</p>

<p>What is this institution, in which man is reputed to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"> 108</a></span>
defend his wife and children with his sword, whom the
law defends, even against him?</p>

<p>In which man is reputed to support by his labor those
who often labor more than he, or who bring him a
dowry?</p>

<p><i>The wife and children are under the jurisdiction of
the tribunal of man!</i> May the gods preserve us from
this frightful return to the manners and customs of the
patriarchs and Romans. Women and children are under
the jurisdiction of the social tribunal, and it is safer
for them: the French wife has not at least to fear that
her Abraham will sacrifice her little Isaac, nor that her
domestic despot, leaving the child on the ground, like
the ancient Roman, will thus condemn it to death. Society
has a heart and generous proctors who, happily,
no longer see the family tribunal in the same light as
Proudhon. It is true that our author is an Epimenides,
awaking after a sleep of more than two thousand years.</p>

<p>I have finished, Master; have you anything more to
say?</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> Certainly. I have to speak of the sphere
of woman. This sphere is "the care of the household,
the education of childhood, the instruction of young
girls under the superintendence of the magistrates, the
service of public charity. We dare not add the national
festivals and spectacles, which might be considered as
the seed-time of love.</p>

<p>"Man is the worker, woman the housewife.</p>

<p>"The household is the full manifestation of woman.</p>

<p>"For woman, the household is an honorable necessity.</p>

<p>"As all her literary productions are always reduced
to a domestic novel, the whole value of which is to
serve, through love and sentiment, to the popularization
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"> 109</a></span>
of justice, so her industrial production is brought back
in conclusion, to the labors of the household; she will
never depart from this circle."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Pardon my astonishment, Master, that
woman, whose mind is <i>irremediably false</i>, who is <i>immoral</i>,
who composes nothing but <i>medleys</i>, <i>monsters</i>,
who <i>takes chimeras for realities, who does not even
know how to write a novel</i>, knows how, notwithstanding,
by your own admission, to write a novel in order
to popularize justice through sentiment and love. She
therefore comprehends, feels, and loves justice?</p>

<p>I remark next, that the cares of the household are
<i>labor</i>;</p>

<p>That education is <i>labor</i>;</p>

<p>That the service of public charity is <i>labor</i>;</p>

<p>That the arrangement and superintendence of festivals
and spectacles presume varied <i>labors</i>;</p>

<p>That to popularize justice through a domestic novel
is <i>labor</i>;</p>

<p>Whence it follows that woman is a <i>worker</i>, that is, a
useful producer; she differs from man, therefore, merely
in the kind of production; and we have only to ascertain
whether the labor of woman is as useful to society
as that of man. I charge myself, when you like, with
establishing this <i>equivalence</i> by <i>facts</i>.</p>

<p>I remark, in the second place, that the education of
childhood, the instruction of young girls, the service of
public charity, the arrangement of festivals and spectacles,
the popularization of justice by literature, do not
form a part of the labors of the household; and that
woman, therefore, is not <i>merely housewife</i>.</p>

<p>I remark, thirdly, that our female superintendents,
merchants, artists, accountants, clerks, and professors,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"> 110</a></span>
are no more housewives than your male superintendents,
merchants, artists, book keepers, clerks, and professors;
that our female cooks and waiting-maids are no
more housewives, than your male cooks, bakers, confectioners,
and footmen; that, in all these functions, and
in many others, women equal men, which proves that
they are not less fitted than you for employments that
do not pertain to the household, and that you are not
less adapted than they to those that do pertain to it.
Rude facts thus stifle your affirmations, and show us
that woman may be <i>something else than housewife or
courtesan</i>.</p>

<p>Lastly, Master, what is the position of all women
relatively to all men?</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> Inferiority; for the entire feminine sex
fills the place with regard to the other sex, in certain
respects, of the wife with regard to the husband: this
proceeds from the sum total of the respective faculties.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> So there is neither liberty nor equality
even for the woman who has not a father or husband?</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> "The truly free woman is the woman
who is chaste; the chaste woman is she who experiences
no amorous emotion for any one, <i>not even for her
husband</i>."&mdash;<i>Vol.</i> III.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Such a woman is not chaste: she is a
statue. Chastity being a <i>virtue</i>, supposes the dominion
of the reason and the moral sense over an instinct:
the chaste woman, therefore, is she who controls a certain
instinct, not she who is destitute of it. I add that
the woman who yields herself to her husband without
attraction, plays the part of a prostitute. I knew well
that you understood nothing either of love or of woman!</p>

<p>Shall we, in conclusion, compare your doctrine concerning
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"> 111</a></span>
the right of woman with that which you profess
concerning right in general?</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> Willingly ... since I cannot do otherwise.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Do you admit that woman is identical in
species with man?</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> Yes, only her faculties are less energetic.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> I grant you this for the sake of discussion.
Expound your general theory concerning right, I will
apply it to woman, and you shall draw the conclusion.</p>


<p class="subh">VII.</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> "The law regulating only human relations,
<i>it is the same for all</i>; so that, to establish exceptions,
it will be necessary to prove that the individuals
excepted are of superior order, or inferior to the human
species."&mdash;<i>Creation of Order in Humanity.</i></p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Now you admit that woman is neither
superior nor inferior to the human species, but is identical
in species with man; the law is therefore the same
for her as for man.</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> I draw the contrary conclusion, <i>because
man is the stronger</i>.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> A contradiction, Master.</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> "Neither figure, nor birth, nor <i>the

it is the same for all."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Now, woman is in essence identical with
man; she differs from him only in manners and qualities
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"> 112</a></span>
which, according to you, by no means make her
differ in essence; once more, therefore, the law is the
same for her as for man.</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> It is logical; but I conclude the contrary,
<i>because man is the stronger</i>.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> A contradiction, Master.</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> "Social equilibrium is the equalization

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Now, according to you, man is the strong

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> It is logical; but I claim that they
should be <i>made unequal</i> in society and in marriage.
Man should have the prepotence, <i>because he is the

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> A contradiction, Master.</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> "From the identity of reason in all

judge than equilibrium, <i>which is equality</i>; the identity

the whole of the 8th <i>Study</i>.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Now, woman is in essence identical with
man. She is born free; between her and man there is,
therefore, no other judge than equality; it is not permissible,
therefore, to establish a hierarchy between
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"> 113</a></span>
<span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> It is logical. But I conclude, on the
contrary, that it is necessary to create a hierarchy between
the sexes, and to give the prepotence to man,
<i>because he is the stronger</i>.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> A contradiction, Master.</p>

fact, necessarily supposes terms in opposition. Attempt
a hierarchy, a prepotence! <i>you think to create order,
you create nothing but absolutism.</i>"&mdash;<i>Justice</i>, <i>Vol.</i> II.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Woman, according to you, forms with
man an organism, that of justice. Now, according to
you, the two halves of the androgynus have different
qualities, which are required to harmonize with each
other in equality under pain of creating absolutism instead
of order; the feminine faculty is therefore required
to form an equipoise with the masculine faculty.</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> It is logical; but I conclude that the
dignity of the humanitary androgynus lies in subjugating
the feminine faculty and creating despotism, <i>because
man is the stronger</i>.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> A contradiction, Master.</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> "Justice is the respect spontaneously

in <i>whatever person</i> and whatever circumstance it may

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Now, woman is a human being, possessing
a dignity which should be respected and guarantied by
the law of reciprocity; therefore one cannot be wanting
in respect to feminine dignity without being wanting in
justice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"> 114</a></span>
<span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> It is logical; but although woman is a
human being, identical in species with man, and although
I believe that there is no other basis of right
than equality, I nevertheless affirm that the dignity of
woman is inferior to that of man, <i>because he is the
stronger</i>.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> A contradiction, Master.</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> "Right is to each the faculty of exacting
from others respect for human dignity in his person,"
duty is "the obligation of each to respect this
dignity in another."&mdash;<i>Justice</i>, <i>Vol.</i> I.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Now, woman being identical in species,
man possesses a dignity <i>equal</i> to hers; therefore she
should be respected in her dignity, that is, in her person,
her liberty, her property, her affections; this is her
right as a human being, and man cannot deny it without
failing in justice and in his duty.</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> It is logical. But I claim that woman
has not the right which my principles attribute to her;
that man alone has rights, <i>because man is the stronger</i>.</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> "Liberty is an <i>absolute</i> right, because it

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> It is logical. But I conclude, on the
contrary, that woman has no need of liberty; that this
condition <i>sine qua non</i> of existence for our species, does
not regard one half of the species; that man alone cannot
exist without liberty, <i>because he is the stronger</i>.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> A contradiction, Master.</p>

without which she would be but a Pariah in society.</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> It is logical. But I nevertheless conclude
from this that woman has no more right to equality
than to liberty. That, although of the same species
as man, and consequently amenable to the law of equality,
nevertheless she is not amenable to it, and should
be unequal and in subjection to man, <i>because he is the
stronger</i>.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Fie, Master! To contradict yourself thus
is disgraceful to your reputation. It would be better to
maintain that woman has not the same rights as man,
because she is of a different species.</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> Woman is bound to feel that she does
not possess a dignity equal to that of man; in the association
formed between them to produce justice, <i>the
notions of right and duty shall be no longer correlative</i>.
Man shall have all rights, and shall accept only such
duties as it shall please him to recognize.
</p>
<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Reflect that man, after having denied the
dignity and the right of woman, will labor to stultify
her more and more in the interest of his despotism!</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">ROUDHON.</span> That does not concern me: the family
should be immured: the husband is priest and king
therein. If, as in the case with all liberty oppressed,
the woman grows restive, we will tell her <i>that she does
not know herself, that she is incapable of judging and
ruling herself</i>; that she is a cypher; we will outrage
her in her moral worth; we will deny her intellect and
activity: and by dint of intimidating her, we will succeed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"> 116</a></span>
in forcing her to be silent: for man must remain
master, <i>since he is the stronger</i>!</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Deny and insult us, Master, this does us
no harm: the lords of the Middle Age employed this
method with their serfs, your sires ... we are now
indignant at them. Slaveholders employed and still
employ this method with the blacks, and the civilized
world is indignant at them, slavery is restricted, and is
on the way to disappear.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I point out your contradictions to my
readers; your authority over minds will be thereby lessened,
I hope.</p>

<p>Those who claim, in accordance with the major of
the preceding syllogisms, that you found right upon
identity of species, an abstraction of individual qualities;
that you believe right and duty correlative; that you
desire equality and liberty, will be quite as nearly right
as those who claim, in accordance with the conclusion
of the same syllogisms, that you base right upon force,
superiority of faculties; that you accept inequality and
despotism, deny individual liberty and social equality,
and do not believe in the correlation of right and duty.</p>

<p>If it is painful to you to have fallen into contradictions
so monstrous, believe that it is not less painful to
me to be forced, in the interest of my cause, to point
them out to the world.</p>

<p>Having taken in hand the cause of my sex, I was
under obligations to parry your attacks by turning
against yourself your allegations against us.</p>

<p>It was necessary to do this, not by denials and declamations
which prove nothing, or by affirmations without
proofs, according to your method of proceeding; but by
opposing to you science and facts; by making use only
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"> 117</a></span>
of the rational method which you extol without employing
it, by charging you often with contradicting yourself
when proofs <i>de facto</i> would have demanded too
much detail and time.</p>

<p>You accuse women of <i>taking chimeras for realities</i>.
I have proved to you that you deserve this reproach,
since your theory is in contradiction to science and
facts.</p>

<p>You accuse women of <i>erecting unreal analogies into
principles</i>.... I have proved that you have done so
as well, in deducing from the <i>pretended</i> absence of physical
germs in woman, the absence of intellectual and
moral germs.</p>

<p>You accuse woman of <i>reasoning wrongly</i>.... I
have brought you face to face with your own principles,
that you might draw from them contradictory conclusions.</p>

<p>You accuse woman of creating nothing but <i>medleys,
monsters</i>.... The anatomy of your theory proves
that you know how to do so quite as well.</p>

<p>You accuse woman of lacking intellect, of want of
justice, virtue, chastity.... I appeal from you to
yourself, and you say positively the contrary.</p>

<p>Where you are fantastic, contradictory, I, <i>a woman</i>,
appeal to logic.</p>

<p>Where you are wanting in method, I, <i>a woman</i>, employ
scientific and rational method.</p>

<p>Where you contradict your own principles, I appeal
to these same principles to judge and condemn you.</p>

<p>Which of us two is the more reasonable and more
rational?</p>

<p>My modesty suffers, I acknowledge, at the thought
that I have played the part of <i>Minerva shaming Ulysses</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"> 118</a></span>
<i>of his paradoxes and his profligacies</i>. At last, this
tiresome part is ended!</p>

<p>I have addressed so many harsh things to you in so
firm and resolute a tone, that I should be sorry to quit
you without a few friendly words coming from my
heart. You ought to be fully convinced of my sincerity,
for you see that you have to deal with a woman
who shrinks from no one; who is never intimidated,
however great may be her opponent, or whatever name
he may bear. You may be my adversary: I shall
never be your enemy, for I regard you as an honest
man, a vigorous thinker, one of the glories of France,
one of the great men of our Comté, always so dear to
the heart of her children; lastly, one of the admirations
of my youth. You and I belong to the great
army that is assaulting the citadel of abuse, and endeavoring
to mine and sap it; I do not shun this solidarity.
Is it so necessary that we should fight? Let
us live in peace; I can entreat it of you without stooping,
since I do not fear you. Understand one thing
that I tell you without bitterness: that you are incapable
of understanding woman, and that by continuing
the struggle, you will inevitably range her under the
banner of the anti-revolutionists.</p>

<p>Your pride has set enmity between you and woman,
and you have bruised her heel: no one would be more
sorry than I to see her crush your head.</p>

<h2 class="normal">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="medium">COMTE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>What thought Auguste Comte, who died in September,
1857.</p>

<p>To solve this question, it is necessary first to divide
the man into two parts; not as the wise king Solomon
designed to divide the child disputed for by two mothers,
but in thought, by making of him two distinct men; a
philosopher and a revealer.</p>

<p>M. Comte, who denied and insulted his master, Saint
Simon, is only the popularizer of his recently edited
works: so much for the rational phase.</p>

<p>What belongs to him exclusively is a socio-religious
organization, which cannot be the work of a healthy
mind.</p>

<p>What belongs to him exclusively, is a heavy, dry,
insulting style, arrogant to the point of being revolting,
loaded and overloaded with adjectives and adverbs.</p>

<p>What belongs to him exclusively, are a few ideas that
he has submerged in volumes, containing not less than
from seven hundred and fifty to eight hundred pages, in
small type. I do not advise you to peruse them, readers,
unless in your heart and soul you believe yourself
deserving of many years of purgatory, which you prefer
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"> 120</a></span>
to expiate on the earth ... I do not know
whether I ought to say above or below, since astronomy
has reversed the positions of the material and spiritual
worlds.</p>

<p>The disciples of Comte are divided into two schools:
that of the Positivist Philosophers, and that of the
Priesthood.</p>

<p>The first reject the religious organization of Comte,
and are in reality nothing but the children of modern
Philosophy, and very estimable adversaries of that nebulous
thing which is called Metaphysics. We could not
therefore have them in sight in this article; so, let not
M. Littré and his honorable friends frown in reading us:
we are about to find fault only with the high priest and
his priesthood.</p>

<p>The doctrine of Comte concerning woman being
connected with the whole of his religious system, let us
first say a word about this system.</p>

<p><i>There is no God; there is no soul</i>: the object of our
adoration should be Humanity, represented by the best
of our species....</p>

<p>There are three social elements: woman, priest, and
man.</p>

<p>Woman is the moral providence, the guardian of
morals.</p>

<p>Had it not been for the wholly mystical love, I willingly
believe, that Comte had for Madame Clotilde
de Vaux, it is probable that woman would not have
been the <i>moral Providence</i>; thanks to this love, she is
nothing less than this. We will see that neither is she
anything more.</p>

<p>Of a nature superior to that of man (in the opinion
of Comte), she is nevertheless subject to him, in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"> 121</a></span>
consequence of a philosophical paradox which we need
not refute here.</p>

<p>The function of woman is to render man <i>moral</i>; a
task which she can perform well only in private life; all
social and sacerdotal functions are therefore interdicted
her.</p>

<p>She should be <i>preserved from labor</i>, should renounce
dowry and inheritance; man is charged with maintaining
her; daughter, she is supported by her father or
her brothers; wife, by her husband; widow, by her
sons. In default of her natural maintainers, the state,
<i>on the requisition of the priesthood</i>, provides for her
wants.</p>

<p>Marriage is instituted for the perfecting of the married
couple, above all, for that of the man: the reproduction
of the species has so little to do with its end,
that the progress of science permits us to hope that, some
day, woman will be able <i>alone</i> to reproduce humanity, so
as to realize and to generalize the hypothesis of the Virgin
Mother. Then it will be possible to regulate human
production, by entrusting to none but the most deserving
women the task of conceiving children and bringing
them into the world, especially members of the priesthood.</p>

<p>Divorce is not permitted, and widowhood is eternal
for both sexes.</p>

<p>Such, in brief, is the Comtist doctrine concerning woman,
marriage and procreation. As the reader might
suspect us of malicious exaggeration, we entreat him to
read attentively the following pages, emanating from the
pen of the originator of the system.</p>

<p>According to him, women have never demanded their
emancipation; the men who claim it for them are, after
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"> 122</a></span>
Comte's usual courteous style, nothing but <i>utopists
corrupted by retrogression</i>. "All transitional ages,'
he says, "have given rise, like our own, to sophistical
aberrations concerning the social condition of woman.
But the natural law which assigns to the effective sex
an existence essentially domestic, has never been materially
altered.... Women were then (in antiquity)
too low to reject worthily, even by their silence, the doctoral
aberrations of their pretended defenders.... But
among the moderns, the happy liberty of the western
women permits them to manifest a decisive repugnance
which is sufficient, in default of rational ratification, to
neutralize these wanderings of the mind, <i>inspired by the
intemperance of the heart</i>.</p>

<p>"Without discussing unreal retrograde utopias, it is
of importance to feel, the better to appreciate real order,
that if women should ever obtain this temporal equality
demanded, without their consent, by their pretended
defenders, their social guaranties would suffer thereby
as much as their moral character. For they would find
themselves thus subjected, in the majority of occupations,
to an active daily competition which they could
not sustain, while at the same time the practical rivalry
would corrupt the principal sources of mutual affection.
Man should support woman, such is the natural law of
our species."&mdash;<i>Politique Positive</i>, t. I.</p>

<p>"It is necessary to consider the just independence
of the affective sex as founded upon two connected conditions,
its universal affranchisement from labor outside
the household, and its free renunciation of all wealth....</p>

<p>"Domestic priestesses of humanity, born to modify
by affection the necessary reign of force, they should
shun, as radically degrading, all participation in command."&mdash;<i>Id.</i>
t. IV.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"> 123</a></span>
"The moral degradation appears to me still greater
when woman enriches herself by her own labor. The
continued eagerness of gain makes her then lose even
that spontaneous kindness which preserves the other
type in the midst of its dissipations.</p>

<p>"No worse industrial chiefs can exist than women."&mdash;<i>Caté.</i>
<i>Pos.</i></p>

<p>So ladies, ye who prefer labor to prostitution, who
pass days and nights in providing for the wants of your
family, it is understood of course that you <i>are degraded</i>;
a woman ought not to do anything; respect and
honor belong to idleness.</p>

<p>You, Victoria of England, Isabella of Spain,&mdash;you
command, therefore you <i>are radically degraded</i>.</p>

<p>M. Comte pretends that masculine superiority is incontestable
in all that concerns the properly called
"source of command ... that the intellect of man is
stronger, more extended than that of woman.</p>

<p>"A healthy appreciation of the universal order will
make the affective sex comprehend how important <i>submission</i>
is to dignity.</p>

<p>"The priesthood will make women feel the merit of
<i>submission</i>, by developing this <i>admirable</i> maxim of
Aristotle: <i>the chief strength of woman consists in surmounting
the difficulty of obeying</i>; their education will
have prepared them to comprehend that all dominion,
far from really elevating, necessarily degrades them, by
depreciating their chief worth so as to expect from
strength the ascendancy which is due to love alone."&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i></p>

<p>Here are a few pages from the system of Politique
Positive, t. IV., which are too curious not to interest
the reader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"> 124</a></span>
"The better to characterize feminine independence,
I think it best to introduce a bold hypothesis, which human
progress perhaps will realize, although it is my
business neither to examine when nor how.</p>

<p>"If the masculine apparatus contributes to our generation
only after a simple excitement, derived from its
organic destination, the possibility may be conceived of
replacing this stimulant <i>by another or several others, of
which the woman would dispose at will</i>. The absence
of such a faculty among the neighboring species cannot
be sufficient to interdict it to the most eminent and most
modifiable race....</p>

<p>"If feminine independence can ever reach this limit,
in accordance with the sum total of moral, intellectual,
and even material progress, the social function of the
affective sex will be found notably improved. Then all
fluctuation between the animal appreciation which still
prevails, and the noble doctrine systematized by positivism,
would cease. The most essential production (that
of our species) would become independent of the
caprices of a perturbating instinct, the normal repression
of which has hitherto constituted the principal obstacle
to human discipline. Such a privilege would be naturally
found transferred, with full responsibility, to the
organs best fitted to its use, alone capable of guarding
themselves from vicious impulses, so as to realize all the
advantages that it permits."</p>

<p>Which means in good English, my female readers,
that perhaps the time will come when you will create
children without the co-operation of these gentlemen;
that this function will be confided to those among you
who shall be most worthy of it, and that they will be
held responsible for the imperfection of the product.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"> 125</a></span>
"Thenceforth," resumes the author, "the utopia of
the Virgin Mother will become to the purest and most
eminent an ideal goal, directly suited to sum up human
perfection, thus carried even to systematizing procreation,
while ennobling it.... Success depends most of
all on the general development of the relations between
the soul and the body, its continued search (that of the
problem of fruitful virginity) will worthily institute the
systematic study of vital harmony, by procuring to it at
once the noblest aim and the best organs."&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i></p>

<p>Translated: the study of the relations of the brain
with the body will lead us to discover the means of procreating
children without the co-operation of man; this
is the noblest aim of this study, as the faculty of being
a virgin mother should be the ideal which the purest
and most eminent women should seek to attain.</p>

<p>"Thus," continues M. Comte, "I am led to represent
the utopia of the Virgin Mother as the synthetic
résume of positive religion, all the phases of which it
combines."&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i></p>

<p>Translation: To procreate children without the concurrence
of man, <i>sums up positive religion, and combines
all its phases</i>.</p>

<p>This may be very fine, but as to being <i>rational</i> and
<i>positive</i>&mdash;what do you think, readers?</p>

<p>"The rationality of the problem," adds the author,
"is founded upon the determination of the true office
of the masculine apparatus, designed especially to supply
to the blood an excitative fluid, capable of strengthening
all the vital operations, whether animal or organic.
In comparison with this general service, the special use
of the fecundative stimulus becomes more and more
secondary in proportion as the organism is elevated. It
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"> 126</a></span>
may thus be conceived that in the noblest species, this
liquid ceases to be indispensable to the awakening of the
germ, which may result artificially from several other,
and even from material sources, especially from a better
reaction of the nervous upon the vascular system."&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i></p>

<p>All this would be possible, I grant, <i>if</i> the fluid of
which you speak, High Priest, had, above all, the general
function which you attribute to it;</p>

<p><i>If</i> the reproduction of our species by the co-operation
of the two sexes were not a <i>law</i>;</p>

<p><i>If</i> we could preserve a species while destroying its
law;</p>

<p><i>If</i> facts did not contradict the possibility of the hypothesis.</p>

<p>Now, to place an <i>if</i> before a natural law and the phenomena
which are its expression, is only a gross absurdity:
we explain laws, we do not reform them without
profoundly modifying the being that they govern; we
do not destroy without destroying this being: for the
individual being is <i>the law in form</i>.</p>

<p>The author dwells as follows on the consequences of
the absurd hypothesis.</p>

<p>"Thence it may be conceived that civilization not
only disposes man better to appreciate woman, but augments
the participation of this sex in human reproduction,
which ought, finally, <i>to emanate from it alone</i>.</p>

<p>"Regarded individually, such a modification ought to
improve the cerebral and corporal constitution of both
sexes, by developing therein continued chastity, the importance
of which has been felt more and more by universal
instinct, even during irregularities.&mdash;p. 277.</p>

<p>"Considered domestically, this transformation would
render the constitution of the human family more in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"> 127</a></span>
conformity with the general spirit of sociocracy, by
completing the just emancipation of woman, thus made,
even physically, independent of man. The normal
ascendancy of the affective sex would be no longer contestable
with respect to children <i>emanated from it exclusively</i>.</p>

<p>"But the principal result would consist in perfecting
the fundamental institution of marriage (the improvement
of the married couple without sexual motive), the
positive theory of which would then become unexceptionable.
Thus purified, the conjugal tie would experience
an amelioration as marked as when Polygamy was
replaced by Monogamy: for we should generalize the
utopia of the Middle Age, in which Maternity was
reconciled with Virginity.</p>

<p>"Regarded civilly, this institution alone permits the
regulation of the most important of productions, which
can never become sufficiently susceptible of systematization,
so long as it shall be accomplished in delirium and
without responsibility.</p>

<p>"Reserved to its best organs, this function would perfect
the human race by better determining the transmission
of ameliorations due to external influences,
both social and personal.... Systematic procreation
coming to remain more or less concentrated
among the better types, the comparison of the two
cases would give rise not only to valuable enlightenment,
but also to an important institution which
would procure to sociocracy the principal advantage of
theocracy. For the development of the new mode
would soon cause a non-hereditary caste to spring up,
better adapted than the common populace <i>for the recruital
of spiritual and even temporal chiefs</i>, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"> 128</a></span>
authority would then rest on a truly <i>superior</i> origin,
which would not shun investigation.</p>

<p>All these indications will suffice to show the value
of the utopia of the Virgin Mother, destined to procure
to Positivism a synthetic résume, equivalent to
that which the institution of the Eucharist furnishes to
Catholicism."&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i></p>

<p>It is much to be feared, alas! that the disciples of
this great man, however ardent seekers of <i>vital harmony</i>
they may be, will never find the <i>synthetic résume</i>
of Positivism, the <i>equivalent</i> of the Eucharist: and it
will be a great pity: to order children as we order shoes,
and leave them on the mother's hands when they do not
suit, would be very convenient.</p>

<p>And what, I ask you, will the future leaders of humanity
do, if they can only obtain respect and obedience
on the condition of proving that they are <i>sons of
virgins</i>?</p>

<p>But we will not jest with so grave a personage as the
High Priest of Humanity: we will only say in passing,
that never was atheist seen to show himself more profoundly
a Christian through contempt for works of the
flesh. Hear what he says on page 286 of the work
before cited:</p>

<p>"Useless to individual conservation, the sexual instinct
co-operates only in an <i>accessory and even equivocal</i>
manner to the propagation of the species. Philosophers
truly freed from superstition should regard it more
and more as tending above all to disturb the principal
design of the vivifying fluid. But without waiting for
the feminine utopia to be realized, we may determine,
<i>if not the atrophy, at least the inertia of this cerebral
superf&oelig;tation</i>, with more facility than is indicated by the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"> 129</a></span>
insufficient efforts of theologism. While positive education
will make the vices of such an instinct everywhere
felt, and <i>will raise up the continued hope of its desuetude</i>,
the whole final system ought naturally to institute
a revulsive treatment with respect to it, more
efficacious than Catholic austerities. For the universal
aspiration of domestic existence and of public life will
develop the sympathetic faculties to such a degree, that
sentiment, intellect, and activity will always concur to
stigmatize and repress the most perturbing of selfish
propensities."</p>

<p>Despite all this <i>aspiration</i>, and all these stigmas, do not
trust to it, High Priest! Be advised by me, use camphor,
and plenty of it; scatter it everywhere as a certain
Amphitryon scattered nutmeg.</p>

<p>It is in prevision of the excommunications hurled by
you against this <i>vile</i>, this <i>useless</i> instinct, that Nature
has been prodigal of camphor.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, you see, my female readers, that if
M. Comte believes us weaker than man in body, mind,
and character, in return, he believes us better.</p>

<p>We are moral providence, guardian angels: he dreams
of affranchisement for us through the subversion of a
natural law.</p>

<p>But meanwhile he places us under the yoke of man
by exempting us from labor;</p>

<p>He rivets our chains by persuading us cajolingly to
despoil ourselves of our property;</p>

<p>He says to us in the gentlest voice imaginable: never
command: it would degrade you;</p>

<p>Your great strength is in obeying him whom <i>it is
your destiny to direct</i>.</p>

<p>You will be naught in the temple, naught in the state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"> 130</a></span>
In the family, you are domestic priestesses, the auxiliaries
of the priesthood.</p>

<p>Three sacraments out of nine are refused you: that
of destiny, because, for you, it is confounded with that
of marriage; that of retirement, because you have no
profession; lastly, that of incorporation, because a woman
cannot, in herself, merit a personal and public apotheosis.</p>

<p>If you have been worthy auxiliaries, you shall be interred
near those whom you shall have influenced, like
their other useful auxiliaries: the horse, the dog, the
cow, and the ass; and mention shall be made of you
when honors shall be paid to the member of humanity
to whom you shall have belonged.</p>

<p>Shall we refute such doctrines? No. Our answer
to them finds a fitter place in the article devoted to M.
Proudhon, who has drawn largely from the doctrine
of M. Comte.</p>

<p>As to the priests who continue the teachings of their
master, it suffices to refer them to what I said to M.
Comte in the <i>Revue Philosophique</i> of December, 1855.</p>

<p>The women of the present time are in general intelligent,
because they receive an education superior to
that of their mothers. The majority of them devote
themselves to an active life either in the arts or the
trades; men acknowledge them as their competitors in
these, and even confess that they are superior in management.
No man, worthy of the name, would dare
contest that woman is his equal, and that the day of
her civil emancipation is close at hand.</p>

<p>Women, on their side, more independent and more
deserving, without having lost anything of their grace
and gentleness, no longer accept the famous axiom:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"> 131</a></span>
<i>man should support woman</i>; still less do they accept
the <i>admirable</i> maxim of Aristotle, fit for the slaves
of the gyneceum. Be sure that every <i>true</i> woman
will laugh at the raiment of clouds which you pretend
to give her, at the incense with which you wish
to asphyxiate her; for she cares no longer for adoration.
She wishes to carry her intellect and activity unfettered
into spheres suited to her aptitudes; she wishes to aid
her brother, man, in clearing up the field of theory, the
domain of practice; she claims that every human being
is the judge of his own aptitudes; she does not recognize
in any man or in any doctrine the right of fixing
her place, and of marking out her road. Through the
labor of war was the patriciate constituted; through
peaceful labor was servitude emancipated; <i>through labor</i>,
also, does woman claim to conquer her civil rights.</p>

<p>Such is what many women are, what they wish to be
to-day; see if it is not madness to seek to revive the
gyneceum and the atrium for these women, impregnated
with the ideas of the eighteenth century, wrought upon
by the ideas of '89 and of the modern reformers. To
say to such women that they shall have no place in the
state, nor in marriage, nor in science, nor in art, nor in
the trades, nor even in your subjective paradise, is something
so monstrous that I cannot conceive, for my part,
how aberration could go so far.</p>

<p>You will no longer find an interlocutress to say:
"that a woman can scarcely ever deserve a personal
and public apotheosis ... that views involving the
fullest experience and the profoundest reflection are
<i>naturally interdicted</i> to the sex whose contemplations
can scarcely go beyond the circle of private life <i>with
success</i> ... that <i>the moral degradation of woman is</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"> 132</a></span>
<i>still greater when she enriches herself by her own
labor</i> ... that there are no worse industrial chiefs
than women...." And if any woman behind the
times should be so imbecile and immodest as to hold
such language, all men of any worth whatever would
regard her only with disdain.</p>

<p>But you, who wish to annihilate woman, from what
principle do you draw such a consequence? That she
is an affective power, you say ... yes, but, as to that,
man is such, likewise; and is not woman, as well as he,
alike intellect and activity? By reason of a purely accidental
predominance, can one half of the human species
be banished beyond the clouds of sentimentality?
And ought not all serious discipline to tend to develop,
not one phase of the being, but the ponderation, the
harmony of all its phases? Want of harmony is the
source of disorder and deformity. The woman who is
solely sentimental commits irreparable errors; the man
who is solely rational is a species of monster, and the
person in whom activity predominates is but a brute.
Since you believe in Gall and Spurzheim, you know
that the encephalon of the two sexes is alike, that it is
modifiable in both, that all education is founded on this
modificability; why has it never occurred to you that
if man <i>en masse</i> is more rational than woman, it is because
education, laws and custom have developed in him
the anterior lobes of the brain; while in woman, education,
laws and custom develop especially the posterior
lobes of this organ; and why, having established these
facts, have you not been led to conclude that, since
organs are developed only in consequence of the excitants
applied to them, it is probable that man and woman,
subjected to the same cerebral excitants, would be developed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"> 133</a></span>
in the same manner, with the shades of difference
peculiar to each individuality; and that for woman
to be developed harmoniously under her three aspects,
she must manifest herself socially under three aspects?
Be sure, sir, your principle is thrice false, thrice in
contradiction to science and reason; in the presence of
the physiology of the brain, all theories of classification
fall to the ground: before the nervous system, women
are the equals of men: they can be their inferiors only
before muscular supremacy, attacked by the invention
of powder, and about to be reduced to dust by the triumph
of mechanism.</p>

<p>I should say many more things to you, sir, were not
this critical sketch too long already; but imperfect
though it may be, having to my mind only the meaning
of a woman's protest against your doctrines, I shall
pause here.</p>

<h2 class="normal">CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="medium">LEGOUVÉ.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The inheritor of a name which commands respect,
Ernest Legouvé, an elegant, eloquent, and impassioned
author, has written a Moral History of Women, whence
exhales a perfume of purity and love which refreshes
the heart and calms the soul.</p>

<p>In every page of this book, we detect the impulse of
an upright heart and lofty mind, indignant at injustice,
oppression, and moral deformity. The author has deserved
well of women, and it is with pleasure that I
seize the opportunity of thanking him in the name of
those who, at the present time, are struggling in various
countries for the emancipation of half the human race.</p>

<p>What is the object of Legouvé's work? We will let
him tell it himself.</p>

<p>"The object of this book is summed up in these
words: to lay claim to feminine liberty in the name of
the two very principles of the adversaries of this liberty:
tradition and difference (of the sexes), that is to say, to
show in tradition progress, and in difference equality.</p>

<p>God created the human species double, we utilize but
half of it; Nature says two, we say one; we must
agree with Nature. Unity itself, instead of perishing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"> 135</a></span>
thereby, would only then be true unity; that is, not the
sterile absorption of one of two terms for the benefit of
the other, but the living fusion of two fraternal individualities,
increasing the common power with all the force
of their individual development.</p>

<p>"The feminine spirit is stifled, but not dead....
We cannot annihilate at our pleasure a force created by
God, or extinguish a torch lighted by his hand; but
turned aside from its purpose, this force, instead of creating,
destroys; this torch consumes instead of giving
light.</p>

<p>"Let us then open wide the gates of the world to
this new element: we have need of it."</p>

<p>Then, examining the position of women, the author
adds: "No history presents, we believe, more iniquitous
prejudices to combat, more secret wounds to heal.</p>

<p>"Shall we speak of the present? As daughters, no
public education for them, no professional instruction,
no possible life without marriage, no marriage without a
dowry. Wives&mdash;they do not legally possess their property,
they do not possess their persons, they cannot
give, they cannot receive, they are under the ban of an
eternal interdict. Mothers&mdash;they have not the legal
right to direct the education of their children, they can
neither marry them, nor prevent them from marrying,
nor banish them from the paternal house nor retain them
there. Members of the commonwealth, they can
neither be the guardians of other orphans than their
sons or their grand-sons, nor take part in a family council,
nor witness a will; they have not the right of testifying
in the state to the birth of a child! Among
the working people, what class is most wretched?
Women. Who are they that earn from sixteen to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"> 136</a></span>
eighteen sous for twelve hours of labor? Women.
Upon whom falls all the expense of illegitimate children?
Upon women. Who bear all the disgrace of
faults committed through passion? Women."</p>

<p>Then, after showing the position of rich women, he
continues: "And thus, slaves everywhere, slaves of
want, slaves of wealth, slaves of ignorance, they can
only maintain themselves great and pure by force of
native nobleness and almost superhuman virtue. Can
such domination endure? Evidently not. It necessarily
falls before the principle of natural equity; and the
moment has come to claim for women their share of
rights and, above all, of duties; to demonstrate what
subjection takes away from them, and what true liberty
will restore to them; to show, in short, the good that
they do not and the good they might do."</p>

<p>The history of the past shows us woman more and
more oppressed in proportion as we trace back the
course of centuries. "The French Revolution (itself),
which renewed the whole order of things in order to
affranchise men, did nothing, we may say, for the affranchisement
of women.... '91 respected almost all of
the feminine disabilities of '88, and the Consulate confirmed
them in the civil code."</p>

<p>This, in Legouvé's opinion was the fault of the philosophy
of the eighteenth century, for "woman is, according
to Diderot, a courtesan; according to Montesquieu,
an attractive child; according to Rousseau, an
object of pleasure to man; according to Voltaire, nothing....
Condorcet and Sieyès demanded even the
political emancipation of woman; but their protests
were stifled by the powerful voices of the three great
continuers of the eighteenth century, Mirabeau, Danton,
and Robespierre."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"> 137</a></span>
Under the Consulate, "feminine liberty had no more
decided enemy (than Bonaparte:) a southerner, the
spirituality of woman was lost on him; a warrior, he
saw in the family a camp, and there required, before all
else, discipline; a despot, he saw in it a state, and there
required, before all else, obedience. He it was who concluded
a discussion in council with these words: <i>There
is one thing that is not French; that a woman can do
as she pleases</i>.... Always man (in the thought of
Bonaparte), always the honor of man! As to the happiness
of woman, it is not a single time in question (in
the civil code.)"</p>

<p>It is in behalf of the weakness of women, it is in behalf
of tradition which shows them constantly subordinate,
it is in behalf of their household functions, that
the adversaries of the emancipation of women oppose it.
"To educate them is to deform them; and they do not
want their playthings spoiled," says M. Legouvé, ironically.
He then continues in a serious strain: "What
matters tradition to us? What matters history to us?
There is an authority more powerful than the consent
of the human race: <i>it is the Right</i>. Though a thousand
more centuries of servitude should be added to
those which have already passed, their accord could not
banish the primordial right which rules over everything,
the absolute right of perfecting one's self which every
being has received from the sole fact that he has been
created."</p>

<p>To those who base their opposition on the domestic
functions of woman, he answers: "If there (in the
household) is their kingdom, then there they should be
queens; their own faculties assure them there of authority,
and their adversaries are forced, by their own principles,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"> 138</a></span>
to emancipate them as daughters, as wives, as
mothers. Or, on the contrary, it is sought to extend
their influence, to give them a rôle in the state, <i>and we
believe that they should have one</i>: well; it is also in
this dissimilarity (between the two sexes), that it is
fitting to seek it. When two beings are of value to each
other, it is almost always because they differ from, not
because they resemble each other. Far from dispossessing
men, the mission of women therefore would be to
do what men leave undone, to aspire to empty places,
in short, to represent in the commonwealth the spirit of
woman."</p>

<p>As is evident, Legouvé demands the civil emancipation
of woman in the name of the eternal Right, in the name
of the happiness of the family, in the name of the commonwealth;
their long standing oppression is an iniquitous
fact, and he casts blame on all who have perpetuated it.
This blame from a man of heart and justice may perhaps
have some weight with those women who are so
much accustomed to bondage that they do not blush at
it&mdash;that they even no longer feel it!</p>

<p>In his first book, "The Daughter," which is divided
into seven chapters, Legouvé takes the child from her
birth; he shows her made inferior in the ancient religions
and systems of legislation by Menu, by Moses,
at Rome, at Sparta, at Athens, and under the feudal
régime; and he asks why, even in our days, the birth
of a daughter is received with a sort of disfavor. It is
because she will neither continue the name nor the
works of her father, says he; it is because her future
gives rise to a thousand anxieties. "Life is so rude and
so uncertain for a girl! Poor, how many chances of
misery! Rich, how many chances of moral suffering!
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"> 139</a></span>
If she is to have only her labor for a maintenance, how
shall we give her an occupation that will support her in
a state of society in which women scarcely earn wherewith
not to die? If she has no dowry, how can she
marry in this world in which woman, never representing
anything but a passive being, is forced to buy a husband?...
From this <i>début</i>, and in this child's cradle,
we have found and caught a glimpse of all the chains
that await women: insufficiency of education for the
rich girl; insufficiency of wages for the poor girl; exclusion
from the greater part of the professions; subordination
in the conjugal abode."</p>

<p>In the second chapter, the author shows by what
gradations the daughter, deprived of the right of inheritance,
has come in our times to share equally with her
brothers; then, passing to the right of education, he
answers those who pretend that to give a solid education
to woman would be to corrupt her and to injure the
family: "The diversity of their nature (man and woman)
being developed by the identity of their studies, it
may be said that women would become so much the
more fully women in proportion as they received a masculine
education.</p>

<p>"Well! it is in the name of the family, in the name
of the salvation of the family, in the name of maternity,
of marriage, of the household, that a solid and earnest
education must be demanded for girls.... Without
knowledge, no mother is completely a mother, without
knowledge no wife is truly a wife. The question is not,
in revealing to the feminine intellect the laws of nature,
to make all our girls astronomers or physicians; do we
see all men become Latinists by spending ten years of
their life in the study of Latin? The question is to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"> 140</a></span>
strengthen their minds by acquaintance with science;
and to prepare them to participate in all the thoughts of
their husbands, all the studies of their children....
Ignorance leads to a thousand faults, a thousand errors
in the wife. The husband who scoffs at science might
have been saved by it from dishonor."</p>

<p>Insisting upon the rights of woman, the author adds:
"As such (the work of God) she has the right to the
most complete development of her mind and heart.
Away then with these vain objections, drawn from the
laws of a day! It is in the name of eternity that you
owe her enlightenment." Further on, he exclaims indignantly:
"What! the state maintains a university
for men, a polytechnic school for men, academies of art
and trades for men, agricultural schools for men&mdash;and
for woman, what has it established? Primary schools!
And even these were not founded by the State, but by
the Commune. No inequality could be more humiliating.
There are courts and prisons for women, there
should be public education for women; you have not
the right to punish those whom you do not instruct!"
M. Legouvé demands, in consequence, public education
for girls in athenæums, "which, by thorough instruction
with respect to France, her laws, her annals, and her
poetry, shall make her women French women in
truth. The country alone can teach love of country."</p>

<p>Ancient religions and systems of legislation punished
misdemeanors and crimes against the purity of women
severely (says M. Legouvé in his fourth chapter). Our
code, profoundly immoral, does not punish seduction,
and punishes corruption only derisively, and violation
insufficiently. To declare void the promise of marriage
is fearful immorality; to permit no investigation of paternity
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"> 141</a></span>
and to admit that of maternity, is as cruel as it
is immoral. If the solicitude of the legislator for property
be compared with his solicitude for purity, we
shall soon see how little the law cares for the latter.
"The law recognizes as criminal only a single kind of
robbery of honor, <i>violation</i>, but it defines, pursues and
punishes two kinds of robbery of money, <i>larceny</i> and
<i>fraud</i>; there are thieves of coin, there are no sharpers
in chastity."</p>

<p>When a man has seduced a girl fifteen years old
under promise of marriage, he has "a right to come
before a magistrate and say: This is my signature, it is
true; but I refuse to acknowledge it; a debt of love is
void in law."</p>

<p>The indignant author exclaims, further on: "Thus,
therefore, on every side, in practice and in theory, in
the world and in the law, for the rich as for the poor,
we see abandonment of public purity, and a loose rein
to all ungoverned or depraved desires.... Manufacturers
seduce their workwomen, foremen of workshops
discharge young girls who will not yield to them, masters
corrupt their servant maids. Of 5083 lost women,
enumerated by the grave Parent-Duchâtelet at Paris in
1830, 285 were servants, seduced by their masters, and
discarded. Clerks, merchants, officers, students deprave
poor country girls and bring them to Paris, where they
abandon them, and prostitution gathers them up....
At Rheims, at Lille, in all the great centres of industry,
are found organized companies for the recruital of the
houses of debauchery of Paris."</p>

<p>With the indignation of an upright man, M. Legouvé
adds: "Punish the guilty woman if you will, but punish
also the man! She is already punished; punished
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"> 142</a></span>
by abandonment, punished by dishonor, punished by
remorse, punished by nine months of suffering, punished
by the burden of rearing a child: let him then be smitten
in turn; or else, it is not public decency that you
are protecting, as you say, it is masculine sovereignty,
in its vilest form: seigniorial right!</p>

<p>"Impunity assured to men doubles the number of
illegitimate children. Impunity fosters libertinism;
libertinism enervates the race, wastes fortunes and
blights offspring. Impunity fosters prostitution; prostitution
destroys the public health, and makes a profession
of idleness and license. Impunity, in short, surrenders
half the human race as a prey to the vices of
the other half: behold its condemnation in a single
word."</p>

<p>In the fifth chapter, the author finding, with reason,
that girls are married too young, desires that they
should not enter upon family duties until twenty-two
years old; works of charity, solid studies, innocent
pleasures, and the ideal of pure love will suffice to keep
them pure till this age. "If the young maiden learns
that nothing is more fatal to this divine sentiment (love)
than the ephemeral fancies which dare call themselves
by its name; if she perceives in it one of those rare
treasures which we win only by conquering them, which
we keep only by deserving them; if she knows that the
heart which would be worthy to receive it must be purified
like a sanctuary and enlarged like a temple; then
be sure that this sublime ideal, engraven within her,
will disgust her, by its beauty alone, with the vain
images that profane or parody it; idols are not worshipped
when God is known."</p>

<p>"What is marriage?" asks M. Legouvé.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"> 143</a></span>
"The union of two free beings, forming an alliance
in order to perfect themselves through love." Neither
antiquity nor the Middle Age considered it in this light.
The father, in ancient times, transmitted to the husband
his right of property in his daughter in consideration of
a certain sum. At Athens, the daughter, even when
married, formed part of the paternal inheritance, and
was bound to leave her husband to espouse the heir.
At Rome, the father, after having given his daughter
in marriage, had the power to take her back and to
espouse her to another. Among the barbarians, she
belonged to him who paid the <i>mundium</i> to her father.
Under the feudal system, the law disposed also of the
daughter without her consent. The French Revolution
emancipated her in this respect; she is required now to
consent to her marriage; but the customs of the age
take from her the benefit of this emancipation; she is
married too young to know what she is doing, and interest
almost always determines her parents to give her in
marriage. For woman to profit by her legal emancipation,
she should be at least twenty-two years old when
she marries; she should make her choice freely; and
her relatives should content themselves with keeping
her apart from those whom she ought not to choose, and
should only enlighten and counsel her; for on the love
between the married couple depends the happiness and
virtue of the wife.</p>

<p>Examining next the origin of the dower, the transferral
of the dowry, the betrothal and the marriage, he
shows the <i>mundium</i> paid at first to the father or the
brother; then later, to the maiden, becoming, with the
rest of the nuptial gifts, the origin of the dower, which
he wishes to see made obligatory in modern times. Passing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"> 144</a></span>
to the dowry, he proves that, becoming by degrees
a custom among the Romans, it was at first the property
of the husband; then, as the world progressed, it became
the property of the wife. Our code fully protects
the dowry; but the law should oblige wealthy parents
to endow their daughters so that they can marry. In
olden times, a maiden was betrothed by pledges exchanged
by the father and the man who asked her in
marriage; at a later date the pledge was given to the
maiden instead of the father, and the law intervened to
render obligatory promises of marriage. At the present
day, in France, there are no longer betrothed, but future
spouses.</p>

<p>In his second book, the author distinguishes the beloved
one from the mistress, the adoration of pure from
that of sensual love; the first produces goodness, patriotism,
and respect for woman; the second regards her
only as an object of pleasure and of disdain. Antiquity
had no knowledge of pure love; the Middle Age,
which comprehended it, was divided equally between it
and sensual love; to-day, we have learned to comprehend
that the two loves should be united; that the
beloved and the mistress should make one in the person
of the wife.</p>

<p>The third book, "The Wife," is divided into seven
chapters.</p>

<p>The subordination of woman in marriage, with contempt
for the mother, arose from two erroneous ideas:
the inferiority of her nature; her passivity in the reproduction
of the species, in which she performed the part
of the earth with respect to the reception of germs.
Modern science has destroyed these bases of inferiority
by demonstrating: 1st, that the human germ, before
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"> 145</a></span>
taking its definitive form, passes, in the bosom of its
mother, through progressive degrees of animal life;
2d, that in all species, both animal and vegetable, the
females are the conservers of the race, which they bring
to their own type.</p>

<p>Among the Romans, two forms of marriage placed
the wife, soul, body and estate, <i>in the hands</i> of her husband;
in a third form, which left her in her father's
family, she received a dowry, inherited, and administered
her property. Barbarism and feudality made the wife
a ward, the husband an administrator, and a step was
taken towards the equality of the spouses by the institution
of <i>acquêts</i>, or property belonging to both, though
obtained by but one. To-day, the maiden is married
sometimes under the dotal system, occasionally under
that of the separation of property, and chiefly under
that of communion of goods. This last, which is the
rule, permits the husband to dispose of the property of
his partner, to sell the household furniture, to take possession
of the very jewels of his wife to adorn his mistress.
"Thus, this law respects no dignity, no delicacy,
nothing whatever," says M. Legouvé. The omnipotence
of the husband is a crime of the law in every
point of view; it is in manifest violation of the modern
principle, which exacts that all authority shall be limited
and placed under surveillance. "To surrender to the
husband the fortune of the wife is to condemn her to an
eternal moral minority, to create him absolute master of
the actions and almost of the soul of his companion."
The author next addresses himself to those who pretend
to justify marital omnipotence by the incapacity of woman:
"In vain do facts protest against this alleged incapacity;
in vain does reality say: To whom is the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"> 146</a></span>
prosperity of most of our commercial houses due? To
women. Who establish, who superintend the thousands
of establishments of millinery and objects of taste?
Women. By whom are the boarding-schools, the farms,
often even, the manufactories, sustained? By women.
It matters not, the Code denies to the wife the foresight
to preserve, the judgment to administer, even the maternal
tenderness to economize, and the marriage certificate
becomes the expression of this disdainful phrase:
the most reasonable woman never attains the good sense
of a boy fourteen years of age." How shall we set to
work to remedy this iniquitous and shameful state of
affairs? The property of the partners should be divided
into three shares: one for the wife, to be placed at her
disposal five years after marriage, one for the husband,
and a third common to both, to be administered by the
husband under the direction of a family council, which
council, in case of incapacity or waste, shall have the
right provisionally to take away the management from
him, to entrust it to his wife.</p>

<p>If anything is iniquitous and revolting, it is the power
of the husband over the person and the actions of his
wife; the right over her of correction, still tolerated in
our days. There must be a directing power in the
household; the husband must be the depositary of this
power, which should be limited, and controlled by the
family council. Legal omnipotence demoralizes the
husband, who believes in the end in the lawfulness of his
despotism. It is said that custom establishes precisely
the contrary of what the laws prescribe: this is generally
true, but it is at the expense of the moral character
of the wife, thus forced to have recourse to artifice.
"Restore liberty to women, since liberty is truth!"
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"> 147</a></span>
exclaims Legouvé. "This will be, at the same time, to
affranchise man. Servitude always creates two slaves:
he who holds the chain and he who wears it."</p>

<p>Antiquity, the Middle Age, and the centuries nearer
our own, punished the adultery of the wife severely,
even cruelly, yet did not admit that a man could become
guilty of this offence with respect to his spouse. Our
present code acknowledges, indeed, that the husband
can commit adultery, but only in case he maintains his
mistress under the conjugal roof; the wife is an adulteress
everywhere, and is punished severely; as to the
husband, his punishment is a farce. "Such impunity,"
says M. Legouvé, "is not only injurious to order, it is
an insult to public morals, <i>it is a lesson of debauchery,
given by the law itself</i>." If, by adultery, the wife
wounds the heart of an honorable man, introduces false
heirs into the family, she at least can abstract nothing
from the common fortune; while the husband, in the
same case, can ruin the family, while increasing the
number of natural children and provoking his wife to
wrong by his neglect and brutality. The husband, besides,
is more criminal than the wife, for he seeks adultery,
while, on the contrary, it comes to the wife under
a thousand attractive forms. Notwithstanding, the
adultery of the woman deserves greater punishment
than that of the man.... Ah! M. Legouvé, is this
logic?</p>

<p>The Oriental wife was and is still, a slave, a generatrix;
the Roman wife was something more than this;
the wife of the Middle Age owed her body to her husband,
but the Courts of Love had decided that her affections
could, nay, should belong to another. To-day,
the ideal of marriage is enlarged; we comprehend that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"> 148</a></span>
it is the fusion of two souls, a school for mutual perfection,
and that the two spouses should belong wholly to
each other.</p>

<p>We have been led to this new ideal of the conjugal
union by the civilizing struggles of the church against
divorce and repudiation. In its nature, marriage is indissoluble,
but in the existing state of things in which
the ideal is but very exceptionally realized, the legislator
has deemed it right to render possible the separation
of the spouses: this measure is immoral and unfortunate
both for the partners and for their children. The
only remedy for family difficulties is <i>divorce</i>, a question
with which the church has nothing to do.</p>

<p>The whole of the last chapter of the third book is a
condemnation of fickleness in love, and an affirmation
of the indissolubility of marriage and of the sanctity of
the conjugal tie.</p>

<p>The fourth book, "The Mother," comprises six chapters.</p>

<p>Until a late day, it was believed that woman was only
the soil in which man, the creator of the species, deposited
the human germ. Modern science has overthrown
this false doctrine, and elevated woman by demonstrating
these three incontestable facts: 1st, that, dating from
the moment of conception, the human germ passes
through successive degrees of animal life until it acquires
its proper form; 2d, that the female sex is the conserver
of the race, since it always brings them to its own type,
as well in the human as in the animal and vegetable
species; 3d, that woman is physiologically of a nature
superior to man, since it is now demonstrated that the
higher the respiratory apparatus is placed in the organism,
the more elevated is the species in the scale of beings;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"> 149</a></span>
and that woman breathes from the upper, and
man from the lower part of the lungs.</p>

<p>Maternity does not give to women rights over their
children, but contributes, notwithstanding, to their emancipation;
thus, in India, a woman who had borne
sons could not be repudiated, and at Rome, a woman
emerged from tutelage at maternity.</p>

<p>It is iniquitous to give the paternal authority to the
father alone; the mother should have an equal right
with him over her children. Supremacy of direction
belongs indeed to the father, but this direction should be
limited and superintended by a family council, and transferred
to the mother in case of the unworthiness of her
spouse.</p>

<p>The education of the children belongs of right to the
mother, because she understands them best, and because
it is necessary that she should acquire that entire influence
over her sons which she will need afterwards to
counsel and to console them. Public education is not fit
for boys until they have attained their twelfth year;
younger, it is injurious in its results to their character.
The author demands that the maternal grand-parents
shall not be made inferior in guardianship, as is the case
now in the law; and he considers it as sacrilege not to
give to the mother an equal right with respect to consent
to the marriage of their children.</p>

<p>Legitimate maternity is happiness to the rich woman;
want, often grief, to the poor woman. Illegitimate maternity
is to women of all ranks a source of sorrow,
shame and crime. To the rich girl it is dishonor, an
eternal bar to marriage; to the poor girl it is poverty,
shame if she keeps her child; crime, if she destroys it.
Yet the law dares grant impunity to the corrupter, to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"> 150</a></span>
the seducer, to the man who has not hesitated to sacrifice
to a moment of passion the whole future of a woman,
the whole future of a child! The State ought to
come to the aid of all poor mothers, because it is for its
interest that the race should be strong and vigorous, and
because mothers are the preservers of the race. Let
the genius of women be set to work; let infant schools
and infant asylums be founded in every quarter of
France.</p>

<p>The Hindoo widow was burned; the Jewish widow
was bound to re-marry certain men designated by the
law; the Grecian and the Gothic widow passed under
the guardianship of her son, and the latter could not
even re-marry without his permission; the Christian
widow was condemned to seclusion; none of these women
had any rights over their children. The French
code restores full liberty to the widow, renders to her
the right of majority, appoints her the guardian and
directress of her children; it is a preliminary step to
liberty in marriage.</p>

<p>The fifth book, <i>Woman</i>, is divided into five chapters.</p>

<p>All antiquity oppressed woman, although it recognized
in her something superior, and made her a priestess
or a prophetess. The Christian woman of the early
ages, who alone could dethrone the Pagan woman, not
only endured martyrdom as courageously as man, but
was distinguished for her great charity, for the purity
and lucidity of doctrine which rendered her the counsellor
of learned men. We do not know, in reality, to
what heights woman can attain; we cannot judge her
by what she is to-day, since she is the work of the eternal
oppression of man. "Who can say whether many
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"> 151</a></span>
of the ills that rend society, and of the insoluble problems
that trouble it, may not be caused in part by the
annihilation of one of the two forces of creation, the
ban placed on female genius? Have we a right to say
to half the human kind: you shall not have your share
in life and in the state? Is it not to deny to them (to
women) their title of human beings? Is it not to disinherit
the state itself? Yes, woman should have her
place in civil life," concludes Legouvé.</p>

<p>Woman and man are equal, but different. To man,
belong synthesis, superiority in all that demands comprehensive
views, genius, muscular force; to woman, belong
the spirit of analysis, the comprehension of details, imagination,
tenderness, grace. Man has more strength of
reason and body, woman more strength of heart, with a
marvelous perspicacity to which man will never attain.
The division thus fixed, what ought woman to do?</p>

<p>In the family, the task of the wife is the management
of domestic affairs, the education of the children, and
the comfort of the husband, of whom she should be the
inspiration. By the side of the eminent man, yet in
the shade, there is always a woman; this career of hidden
utility and of modest devotion is the one best suited
to woman. In civil life there are several fields of occupation
which they may enter with success: art, literature,
instruction, <i>administration</i>, medicine. "Modesty
itself demands that we should call in women as physicians,
not to men, but to women; for it is an abiding outrage
upon all purity that their ignorance should forcibly
expose to masculine curiosity the sufferings of their sisters....
Nervous diseases, especially, would find in
feminine genius the only adversary able to understand
and combat them." The author says that it is the duty
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"> 152</a></span>
of society to see that poor women do not work for one-third
or one-fourth the wages of men; and that, in
manufactures, they have not the most dangerous and
least remunerative labors. "Parent-Duchâtelet," says
he, "attests that of three thousand lost women, <i>only
thirty-five had an occupation that could support them</i>,
and that fourteen hundred had been precipitated into
this horrible life by destitution. One of them, when
she resolved on this course, <i>had eaten nothing for three
days</i>." M. Legouvé thinks it shameful that men should
enter into competition with women in the manufacture
of articles of dress and taste.</p>

<p>In the fifth and last chapter, the author recognizes
the remarkable capacity of women in administration, of
which he cites numerous examples. He demands that
they should have the superintendence of prisons for
women, hospitals, charitable institutions, the legal guardianship
of foundlings, the management, in short, of all
that concerns social charity, because they will acquit
themselves in it infinitely better than men. But he
refuses to them all participation in political acts and in
all that concerns the government, because they have no
aptitude for things of this nature. Finally, he concludes
thus: "Our task is finished; we have examined the
principal phases of the life of women, in the character
of daughters, wives, mothers, and women, comparing
the present with the past, and endeavoring to indicate
the future; that is, by pointing out the bad, verifying
the better, seeking the best.</p>

<p>"What principle has served us in this as a guide?
Equality in difference.</p>

<p>"In the name of this principle, what ameliorations
have we demanded in the laws and customs?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"> 153</a></span>
"For daughters:</p>

<p>"Reform in education.</p>

<p>"Laws against seduction.</p>

<p>"The postponement of the marriageable age.</p>

<p>"The actual participation of the betrothed parties in
the execution of their contract.</p>

<p>"Abolition of the formal request to the father of consent
to marriage, which is an insult to the father and an
injustice to the child.</p>

<p>"For wives:</p>

<p>"An age of legal majority.</p>

<p>"Administration, and the right of disposing of a
portion of their private property.</p>

<p>"The right to appear in law without the consent of
their husbands.</p>

<p>"The limitation of the power of the husband over
the person of the wife.</p>

<p>"The creation of a family council, charged with controlling
this part of the power.</p>

<p>"For mothers:</p>

<p>"The right of government.</p>

<p>"The right of direction.</p>

<p>"The right of education.</p>

<p>"The right of consent to the marriage of their
children.</p>

<p>"A law requiring the investigation of paternity.</p>

<p>"The creation of a family council to decide on serious
disagreements between father and mother.</p>

<p>"For women:</p>

<p>"Admission to guardianship and the family council.</p>

<p>"Admission to all professions.</p>

<p>"Admission within the bounds of their capabilities
and duties to public offices."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"> 154</a></span>
It is evident that Legouvé has but one end, that of
advancing the emancipation of women a single step;
he does not demand all that he believes just, but all that
seems to him mature and possible.</p>

<p>We should thank him for his prudence: he has
brought over many men to our cause, and has prepared
them to hear the voice of woman, speaking loudly and
firmly by her right as a wife and a human being, as a
worker and a member of the social body.</p>

<p>By the side of Legouvé, outside the social schools,
are a phalanx of just and generous men who have
written in our favor. We thank them all for their good
words.</p>

<h2 class="normal">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="medium">DE GIRARDIN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>On page 42 of his pamphlet, "Liberty in Marriage,"
De Girardin says, with great reason: "Man is born of
woman. Everything, therefore, that benefits woman
will benefit man."</p>

<p>"To fight and conquer for her is to fight and conquer
for himself."</p>

<p>Inspired by these excellent sentiments, the celebrated
publicist has investigated the causes of the slavery and
degradation of woman, and the means of paralyzing
them.</p>

<p><i>Every child has for its father the husband of its
mother</i>: this, according to M. de Girardin, is the principle
of two great wrongs: the servitude of the married
woman; the inequality of children before the law,
which classes them as legitimate and illegitimate.</p>

<p>That children may become equal, that woman may
be affranchised from the yoke of man, it is necessary,
says the author, to substitute the system of maternity
for that of paternity; to modify Marriage, and to render
woman independent through the institution and
universalizing of the dower.</p>

<p>We will let M. de Girardin expound the rest of his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"> 156</a></span>
doctrine himself. "We must choose," says he, "between
these two systems:</p>

<p>"Between the system of <i>presumed</i> paternity, <i>which
is the system of the law</i>, and the system of maternity,
<i>bearing its proof within itself, which is the system of
Nature</i>; the latter is in conformity with incontestable
truth, the former is condemned by undisputed statistics.
The system of paternity is <i>inequality of children before
the mother and before the law; it is woman possessed
and not possessing</i>; ... it is no longer the legal slavery
of woman, <i>but is still conjugal servitude</i>."&mdash;<i>Liberty
in Marriage.</i></p>

<p>"Without equality of children before the mother,
equality of citizens before the law <i>is only an imposture</i>,
for evidently and incontestably, this equality does not
exist for 2,800,000 children, who, arbitrarily entitled
illegitimate, are placed outside of common right in violation
of natural law."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>According to De Girardin, the logical consequences
of the system of maternity would be:</p>

<p>The abolition of civil marriage;</p>

<p>The mother's name alone given to the child;</p>

<p>The inheritance placed solely in the maternal line.</p>

<p>"Marriage," says he, "is a purely individual act,
and, as regards its celebration, a purely religious act.&mdash;</p>

<p>"Marriage is an act of faith, not of law: it is for
faith to govern it, <i>not for law to make rules for it</i>.</p>

<p>"As soon as the law intervenes, it intervenes <i>without
right</i>, without necessity, <i>without utility</i>.</p>

<p>"For one abuse that it pretends to avert, it gives rise
to innumerable others which are worse, and from which
society afterwards suffers seriously, without taking into
account the cause that produced them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"> 157</a></span>
"Legal liberty in marriage is durable love in the
household; indissolubility of marriage is habitual love
outside of the household."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>With respect to inheritance and dowry, the author
expresses himself thus:</p>

<p>"To inherit at the death of the mother, because maternity
and certitude are two equipollent terms, and to
receive a support from the father, because paternity and
doubt are two inseparable terms; such is the true law
of Nature."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>In De Girardin's opinion, woman has the same rights
as man to liberty and equality; the sexes are equal, not
through <i>similitude</i> but <i>equivalence</i> of faculties and functions;
man produces, acquires, woman administers,
economizes; it belongs therefore to man to provide for
the expenses of the household. It is his duty, on uniting
himself to a woman, to settle on her an inalienable
dower that will permit her to perform her maternal
functions properly, and to escape from the vices that
frequently result from want and abandonment.</p>

<p>To the objection that the wages of the working people
are insufficient to satisfy this duty, the generous publicist
replies: Well, raise the rate of wages by excluding
from industrial occupations the women and children
that lower it by competition with men. And if this
measure be not sufficient to balance receipts and expenses,
increase the wages, for "there is no consideration
weighty enough to make me admit that, in order
not to diminish the profits of some men, others shall be
eternally condemned to insufficient wages; and that to
shelter some women from violation, others shall be
necessarily devoted to prostitution."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>In comparing the lot of the wife under the two systems,
De Girardin expresses himself thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"> 158</a></span>
"Under the system of paternity, the wife, loaded
with the gifts of fortune, sinks under the weight of an
idleness which most frequently inflames and disorders
her imagination. She does not know what to do to
employ her time. Woman does nothing because man
does everything.</p>

<p>"The wife who has brought no dowry and received
no dower, sinks under the weight of a toil contrary to
nature which obliges her, through economy, to separate
herself from her child a few days after giving it birth,
and to put it away from her to nurse, for the consideration
of five or six francs a month; to go to work in one
direction while her husband works in the other, and not
to rejoin him till evening, when each returns from the
workshop which has kept them absent from their household
all day: if this is what is called the family, <i>is it
indeed worth all the stir that is made about it</i>?</p>

<p>"Under the system of maternity, on the contrary,
the richer a woman is, the further she is removed from
idleness; for not only has she her children to nurse, to
rear, to instruct, and to watch over, but she has also to
administer her fortune which will one day be theirs.</p>

<p>"To preserve this fortune, to increase it still more:
here is wherewith to occupy her leisure, to calm her
imagination, to place her under curb. It is wrong to
suppose women not qualified for the management of
business; they excel in it, however little may have been
their practice or application.</p>

<p>"Long enough has man been the personification of
war, of slavery, of conquest; it is the turn of woman
to be the personification of peace, of liberty, of civilization.</p>

<p>"In this new system (<i>that of maternity</i>), each of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"> 159</a></span>
two has his part: to man labor, the genius of enterprise;
to woman economy and the spirit of foresight.</p>

<p>"Man speculates, woman administers;</p>

<p>"Man acquires, woman preserves;</p>

<p>"Man brings in, woman transmits;</p>

<p>"The dowry remains the attribute of the father, the
inheritance becomes the privilege of the mother;</p>

<p>"Each of the two thus exercises the function that is
<i>natural</i> to him, and in conformity with the essence of
things."&mdash;<i>Id.</i></p>

<p>A number of women have asked whether De Girardin
recognizes political right for women. He says
nothing about it, either in his work "Liberty in Marriage,"
or in his "Universal Politics." But when a man
writes that:</p>

<p>"Woman, belonging to herself, and being dependent
only on her reason, has the same rights as man to liberty
and equality."</p>

<p>That "universal suffrage should be <i>individual</i> and
<i>direct</i>."</p>

<p>That "every holder of a general insurance has a
right to be a party to it."</p>

<p>It is evident that we may deduce, without any great
stretch of logic, that, woman being <i>free and equal to
man</i>,</p>

<p>Woman being comprised in universality,</p>

<p>Woman holding, like man, her policy of insurance,
has a right, like man, to be elector, to be eligible to office,
and to vote <i>individually and directly</i>.</p>

<p>Now, as M. de Girardin is not one of those who
recoil from the consequences of their principles, we are
led to believe that he admits to woman the exercise
of political right for woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"> 160</a></span>
I have been told that, in 1848, one of those pitiable
individuals who have neither intellect enough to be logical,
nor justice enough to comprehend the oppressed,
was haranguing before M. de Girardin against the
claims of certain women to enter political life. "Why
not?" asked M. de Girardin. "Do you believe that
Madame de Girardin would deposit a less intelligent
vote in the electoral urn than that of her footman?"</p>

<p>If this anecdote be true, the opinion of the publicist
concerning the political right of woman is not doubtful.</p>

<p><i>La liberté dans le mariage</i> has raised a tempest of
indignation, to a greater or less degree feigned, among
the prudes; and for some time it required courage openly
to proclaim one's self the (feminine) champion of the
author.</p>

<p>Abolish marriage! cry some, veiling their faces with
an air of offended modesty.</p>

<p>Make a speculation of love! exclaim others who,
apparently, have preserved their holy innocence and baptismal
ignorance.</p>

<p>Come, ladies, we might say,&mdash;a truce to conventional
delicacy and sentimentality. Let men suffer
themselves to be deceived by our mask, nothing is more
natural; but what is the use of playing the farce among
women?</p>

<p>M. de Girardin does not really suppress marriage;
he changes it in some respects, but leaves it intact in a
religious point of view. If his system should be adopted,
therefore, you might be married in the presence of
the clergymen of your respective faiths, precisely as
was done some seventy years ago, and you would have
no fewer scruples than your grandmothers, who believed
themselves then sufficiently married.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"> 161</a></span>
On the other hand, in suppressing civil marriage, the
author does not interdict such and such particular stipulations;
if therefore you hold in any degree to the
religion of the Code, it will be lawful for you to stipulate
in your notarial contract:</p>

<p>1. That you will be submissive to your husbands;</p>

<p>2. That you will permit them to manage your fortune,
even contrary to your interests and to those of
your children;</p>

<p>3. That without authority from them, you will neither
go to law, nor undertake anything, nor sell anything,
nor receive anything, nor give anything away;</p>

<p>4. That, so long as they shall live, you renounce all
authority over your children; that they can, if they
please, take them from you, banish you from them,
have them reared by whoever they choose, even by
their mistress, finally, give them in marriage contrary
to your will;</p>

<p>5. That you recognise their right to carry elsewhere
their love, their attentions, their fortune and
your own; provided that this does not happen under
your roof;</p>

<p>6. That, lastly, you grant their right, if, abandoned
by them, you attach yourself to another, to drag you before
the bar, to dishonor you, to imprison you with thieves
and prostitutes; that even in such case you declare
them excusable in killing you.</p>

<p>Yes, ladies, you might stipulate all this, for M. de
Girardin disputes no one the rights of lacking dignity
and being imbecile; of what then do you complain?</p>

<p>You reproach M. de Girardin with wishing to make
a speculation of love! Be good enough to tell me
what you call the greater part of the marriages of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"> 162</a></span>
present time, in which men have the heartlessness to
speculate even on death!&mdash;in which they ask how much
a young girl has, what are her expectations, and <i>how
old are her parents</i>.</p>

<p>Answer, women:</p>

<p>Is it true that the great majority of seduced women
are incapacitated, through shame and poverty, from
rearing their children?</p>

<p>That what you call a first fault, drives the greater
part of them to make a traffic of their charms?</p>

<p>That the great majority of men forget, after satisfying
their passion, both the woman whom they have
led astray, and the innocent creature that owes its life
to them?</p>

<p>Is it true that the horrible and cruel selfishness of
men and the insane confidence of women produces annually
a fearful number of so called illegitimate children,
the greater part of which people the prisons, the
galleys, and the public brothels?</p>

<p>Is it true, lastly, that this same selfishness and this
same confidence are the cause of thousands of human
lives being criminally sacrificed?</p>

<p>And if all this shame, all these griefs, all these crimes
are true?</p>

<p>If there are so many women seduced and heartbroken;</p>

<p>If there are so many children abandoned;</p>

<p>If there are so many infanticides;</p>

<p>If the law does not protect the woman deceived and
made a mother;</p>

<p>If this law does not compel the seducer to any reparation;</p>

<p>If public opinion leaves to the victim all the shame;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"> 163</a></span>
Why do you reproach a man for reminding a young
girl that from love may proceed maternity?</p>

<p>For telling her that she ought to provide in advance
for the child that may be born, in order that it may not
be cast upon public charity, and that she herself may
not risk falling into those sinks of impurity that are the
shame and degradation of our sex?</p>

<p>Do you reproach a man then for taking our part
against the selfish and animal passions of his sex, and
against the impunity accorded them by the laws?</p>

<p>Do you reproach him for taking in hand the cause
of morals and health, in opposition to the degradation
of soul and body?</p>

<p>A young girl stipulate the sale of her person! say
you? what essential difference do you find between
this kind of contract, and those that are made to-day
before the notary on the occasion of a marriage?</p>

<p>Did not most among you, ladies, purchase your husbands
with so much dowry, so much income, so much
<i>expectations</i>? And if these husbands of yours did not
think it shameful to be sold, and if you do not esteem
them less for it, be good enough to tell me from what
principle you judge it shameful for a young girl to do
the same in order to rear her children, and to live without
prostituting herself?</p>

<p>For my part, I do not see.</p>

<p>Ladies, you are grown-up children: men feign to
have contempt for the woman who thinks of her interests
in love ... because they wish, if possible, to
keep their money, that is all.</p>

<p>Is this to say that I admit all the ideas of M. de Girardin?
No.</p>

<p>I admit with him, that woman can only be free and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"> 164</a></span>
the equal of man, in so far as she is a wife, through a
change in marriage.</p>

<p>That, in the state of insecurity in which she is placed
with respect to wages and to maternity outside of marriages,
woman <i>does well</i> to take measures to prevent
man from shifting the obligations of paternity from
himself to her.</p>

<p>I would willingly admit that the child should bear
the mother's name only, if men did not object so strongly
to it. The child, belonging to both, should bear
both names, and choose, at majority, the one that he
preferred; or else the daughters should bear the name
of the mother and the sons that of the father, from the
time of majority.</p>

<p>I readily admit the equality of children before the
mother and the law; for bastardy is meaningless in nature
and is social iniquity. But what I do not admit, is the
ideal M. de Girardin has formed with regard to the
respective functions of each sex:</p>

<p>The exclusion of woman from active occupations;</p>

<p>The universalizing of the dower;</p>

<p>Lastly, family education.</p>

<p>To say that man represents labor, the genius of enterprise,
that he speculates, acquires, brings in,&mdash;that
woman represents economy, the spirit of foresight,&mdash;that
she administers, preserves, transmits, is to establish
a series which does not appear to me at all in conformity
with the nature of things, since it is notorious that
a great number of women do what M. de Girardin attributes
to the other sex, and <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p>Functions, to be properly performed, should be the
result of aptitudes. Now Nature, except in what concerns
the reproduction of the species, does not appear to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"> 165</a></span>
have classed these according to the sexes. Since the
origin of society, we have attempted to do it, but history
is at hand to reveal to us that, in acting thus, we
have only succeeded in tyrannizing over the sturdy minorities
that have given the lie to such pretensions.
Now, M. de Girardin, admitting a false series, <i>à priori</i>,
is led without perceiving it to forge chains for all women
whom Nature has not made in conformity with the conventional
order which he wishes to see realized.</p>

<p>To exclude woman from active occupations in order
to confine her to the cares of the household is to attempt
an impossibility, to close the way to progress, and
to replace woman beneath the yoke of man. It is to
attempt an impossibility, because there are branches of
manufactures that can be executed only by women;
because many women who would not marry, or who
would be left portionless widows without resources,
could only remain pure by devoting themselves to some
active employment which, notwithstanding, would be
interdicted to them. To see woman in the household
alone, is to view her from a contracted stand point,
which retards the advent of her liberty. It is to close
the way to progress, because there are social functions
which will never be well performed until woman shall
participate in them, and social questions that will never
be resolved until woman shall stand by the side of man
to elucidate them. It is to replace woman beneath the
yoke of man, because it is in human nature to rule and
domineer over those whom we provide with their daily
bread.</p>

<p>To wish to erect the dower into an institution, is to
wish to restore one of the most lamentable phases of the
Past at the moment when Humanity is marching towards
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"> 166</a></span>
the Future&mdash;that which shows us woman purchased
by man. The universalizing of the dower
would be therefore a criminal attempt on the liberty
and moral dignity of woman. Lastly, to claim that
every mother ought to educate her children herself appears
to us to propose as great impossibility as social
danger.</p>

<p>If every well constituted woman is fit to bring children
into the world and to nourish them with her milk,
very few are capable of developing their intellect and
heart, for education is a special function, requiring a
particular aptitude, with which all mothers cannot be
endowed.</p>

<p>Next, family education perpetuates divergence of
opinions and sentiments, maintains prejudices, favors
the development of vanity and selfishness, and tends, by
this means, to paralyze the most noble, the most civilizing
sentiment&mdash;that of universal solidarity. Assuredly,
at the present time, many motives may justify
family education, but for the good of humanity it is to
be desired that parents who sympathize in progressive
ideas should assemble their children together to form
them for social life, instead of rearing them each by
himself.</p>

<p>I submit this critical sketch to M. de Girardin in the
name of the principle that he has always defended:&mdash;<i>individual
dignity and human liberty</i>.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"> 167</a></span></p>
<h2 class="normal">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="medium">MODERN COMMUNISTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The Communists hold as the principle of social organization,
not <i>the agrarian law</i>, as has been charged
on them through ignorance or bad faith, but the enjoyment
<i>in common</i> of the soil, of implements of labor,
and of products. <i>From each one according to his
strength, to each one according to his needs</i>, is the formula
of most among them.</p>

<p>It is not our business to examine the social value of
this doctrine, but only to show what Communism thinks
of woman and her rights.</p>

<p>The modern communists may be divided into two
classes: the religious and the political.</p>

<p>Among the first are the Saint Simonians, the Fusionists
and the Philadelphians.</p>

<p>Among the second, are the Equalitarians, the Unitarians,
the Icarians, etc.</p>

<p>The first consider woman as the equal of man. To
the others, she is free; among some, with a shade of subordination.</p>

<p>The Unitarians, who have drawn largely from Fourier,
proclaim woman free, and equal with man.</p>

<p>We shall speak here of only a few of the communistic
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"> 168</a></span>
sects, reserving for separate articles what relates to
the Saint Simonians and the Fusionists.</p>

<p>The Philadelphians, admitting God and the immortality
of the soul, lay down these two principles: God
is the chief of the social order; Fraternity is the law
that governs human relations.</p>

<p>Religion, to the Philadelphians, is the practice of Fraternity;
Progress is a dogma, Community is the law of
the individual before God and conscience.</p>

<p>Touching the relations of the sexes and the rights of
woman, M. Pecqueur thus expresses himself in his
work <i>La République de Dieu</i>, pp. 194, 195:</p>

<p>"Complete equality of the man and the woman."</p>

<p>The Monogamic marriage, intentionally indissoluble
as a normal condition; such is the second practical consequence
of the dogma of religious fraternity.</p>

<p class="subh">1. <span class="smallc">EQUALITY.</span></p>

<p>"We bring no proofs in evidence of this; <i>his reason
is blotted out by prejudice and his heart chilled by
egotism</i>, who is not impressed at once with the truth of
equality.</p>

<p>"In the state of society created by the religion of
fraternity and equality, women will find, from their earliest
years, <i>the same means and the same conditions of
development of function and of remuneration</i>, in short,
<span class="smallc">THE SAME RIGHTS</span>, the same social aim to pursue as men;
and in proportion as custom shall correspond with the
religious and moral ends of the union, will the living
law deduce the practical consequences of all order, contained
in the germ in the dogma of the complete equality
of the sexes.</p>

<p class="subh"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"> 169</a></span>
"4. <span class="small">MONOGAMY AND INDISSOLUBILITY.</span></p>

<p>"To comprehend the lawfulness of the unlimited or
indefinite monogamic marriage, it suffices to consider:
1st. the exigencies of our inmost nature, that is, the characteristics
of love; its instinctive aspiration to the union
and the fusion of two beings, to duration and to perpetuity;
the necessity of possessing each other reciprocally
and of having faith in this possession <i>in order to love
each other</i>; in short, instinct, desire; the irresistible and
universal affections, and the joys of paternity and of the
family; 2d. the physiological conditions of generation,
which exact monogamy in order to assure the reproduction
and the good and progressive conservation of the
species; 3d. social and religious exigencies, which require
relations of all kinds to be predetermined and regulated,
that each one may be secure in his expectation and his
possession, and that there may be a possibility of satisfying
the fundamental propensities of our natures.... To
claim to introduce polygamy, promiscuousness, or union
for a term of years into such surroundings, (the Philadelphian
society,) is evidently to decree selfishness and
mere carnal pleasure, while proclaiming duty and dignity.
It is inconceivable that two moral beings, once
united by pure love, should ever cease to love each other,
to delight in each other, or at least to endure each
other, when they are presumed already to be devoted
and sacrificing without distinction in their love to their
brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>"Still less is it conceivable that their brothers and
sisters would dream of diverting this reciprocal love of
two members of the family to their personal advantage;
<i>for this would be infamy</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"> 170</a></span>
M. Pecqueur admits, notwithstanding, that in very
rare cases, divorce may be granted on account of incompatibility
of temper. In such case the offending
party would be excluded from the republic, and the other
would be at liberty to remarry.</p>

<p>According to M. Pecqueur, indissolubility of marriage
does not relate to the present antagonistic state of
society, as he says:</p>

<p>"Divorce is a great misfortune, not only to the parties
concerned, but to religion; notwithstanding, in the
kingdom of Cæsar in which pure justice is the question,
it is the lesser evil, when the individuals are determined
on a separation in fact, and are lusting after other
ties. They do evil clandestinely; they are the cause
or the occasion of the temptation or the fall of others.
Do what they will, the scandal is known; so that neither
society, nor the spouses, nor the children, nor morality
derive benefit from the consecration of absolute
perpetuity.</p>

<p>"It is not charitable, it is <i>impious</i> to force two beings
to remain together, one of which, to say the least, maltreats,
detests, takes advantage of, or domineers over
the other. It is equally wrong to grant them a separation
from bed and board without at the same time permitting
them to yield to chaste affections when they acknowledge
these in purity and liberty."</p>

<p>So then, to the Philadelphians, expounded by M.
Pecqueur, marriage is monogamous, indissoluble by intention;
divorce is a sad necessity of the existing state
of society, whilst separation is immorality. In short,
woman is <i>free and the equal of man</i>.</p>

<p>Another communist sect, that of the Icarians, takes
no notice either of the nature or the rights of women.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"> 171</a></span>
Its chief, M. Cabet, an ex-attorney-general, was too
fully imbued with the doctrines of the Civil Code, that
inelegant paraphrase of the Apostle Paul, not to be persuaded
that woman ought to remain outside the pale of
political right, and that she ought to be subordinate to
man in general, and to her husband, good or bad, in
particular.</p>

<p>Let us do justice however to M. Cabet's disciples; I
have never found a single one of them of his opinion
on this great question.</p>

<p>One evening in 1848, as M. Cabet was presiding over
a well attended club, he was requested by a woman to
put the question: <i>Is woman the equal of man before
social and political rights?</i> Almost every hand was
raised in the affirmative; in the negative, not a hand was
raised, not a man protested against the affirmation. A
round of applause followed from the galleries filled with
women; and M. Cabet was somewhat disconcerted by the
result. He seemed to be ignorant that the people, always
eminently logical, are never guilty of quibbling to elude
or to limit the principles that they have adopted.</p>

<p>This vote of the Cabet club was repeated in three
others, in my presence. The men in paletots laughed at
the demands of brave Jeanne Deroin; the men in blouses
did not even smile at them.</p>

<p>M. Dezamy representing another shade of communism,
thus expresses himself in the code of the Community;
"Away with marital dominion! Freedom of alliance!
<i>perfect equality of both sexes!</i> Freedom of divorce!"</p>

<p>He adds, under the heading; Laws for the union of
the sexes, designed to prevent all discord and debauchery,
page 266:</p>

<p>"Art. I. Mutual love, inmost sympathy, purity of
heart between two beings, form and legalize their union.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"> 172</a></span>
"Art. II. <i>There should be perfect equality between
the two sexes.</i></p>

<p>"Art. III. No bond except that of mutual love can
link the man and the woman together.</p>

<p>"Art. IV. Nothing shall prevent lovers who have
separated from forming new ties as often as they shall
be attracted to another person."</p>

<p>The ethics of M. Dezamy are not to our taste; we
prefer those of the Communist, Pecqueur; but we are
glad to prove that modern communism, divided on the
questions of marriage, the family, and morals in relations
of the sexes, is unanimous with respect to the liberty of
woman and the equality of the sexes before the law and
society.</p>

<p>In this, modern communism is greatly superior to
that of the ancient school, practised among several nations,
and taught by Plato, Morelly, etc. We recognize
a sign of the times in this juster appreciation of
woman, with the introduction of the principle of her
rights into doctrines which formerly never took them
into account.</p>

<p>The greater part of the Communists belong to the working
class; which proves that the people most of all
feel the great truth, <i>that the liberty of woman is identical
with that of the masses</i>; and it will take more than
MM. Proudhon, Comte, Michelet and their adepts, to
throw cold water on their feelings and to make them retrace
their steps.</p>

<p class="subh">SAINT SIMONIANS.</p>

<p>My mother, a zealous Protestant and very austere in
morals, disapproved of St. Simonianism, and never permitted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"> 173</a></span>
any one to speak of it in my presence except to
condemn it; she took great care that not a line of the
new doctrine should fall under my eyes.</p>

<p>Whether from a natural spirit of opposition or from
instinctive justice, I know not, but I by no means
shared in the censure that I heard expressed about me;
one thing alone resulted from it&mdash;curiosity to become
acquainted with what were called immoral dogmas.</p>

<p>I was in this frame of mind when one day while with
my mother in the neighborhood of the <i>Palais du Justice</i>, I
saw a company of men advancing, clad in a graceful
costume; they were the Saint Simonians going in a
body to defend their infant church against prosecution
at the bar. I was greatly moved by the sight; I felt
in communion with these youth who were about to bear
testimony to their faith; they did not seem like strangers,
but as struggling for my own cause or for one that
deserved my sympathy, and tears sprang to my eyes. I
could have heartily embraced those whom I heard defending
them, and as heartily have assailed those who
claimed that it would be just to condemn them. My
mother being too generous to join with the latter, we departed
in silence. I knew, without having any knowledge
of the details, that the church of St. Simon had
been dispersed.</p>

<p>It was not until some years after that, having made
the acquaintance of a St. Simonian lady, I was enabled
to read the doctrinal writings and to form an idea
of the aspirations and the dogmas of the school of
St. Simon. If the nature of this work forbids me their
analysis, it cannot reproach me for expressing my sympathies
for those who have had great and generous aspirations;
for those who, in a critical point of view,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"> 174</a></span>
have rendered real services to the cause of Progress; for
those who have brought to light the solution of the two
capital problems of our epoch; <i>the emancipation of woman
and of the workman</i>. The St. Simonians have been
enough assailed, enough calumniated to justify a woman
who is not a St. Simonian in considering it a duty to
render them justice, by acknowledging the good which
they have done.</p>

<p>Yes, you have a right to be proud of your name of
St. Simonians, you who have proclaimed the obligation
of laboring without respite for the physical, moral and
intellectual amelioration of the most numerous and the
poorest class;</p>

<p>You who have proclaimed the <i>sanctity</i> of science,
art, manufactures, and labor in every form;</p>

<p>You who have proclaimed the equality of the sexes
in the family, the church, and the state;</p>

<p>You who have preached of peace and fraternity to a
world given over to wars of cannon and competition.</p>

<p>You who have criticised the ancient dogma, and all
the evil institutions that have thence arisen;</p>

<p>Yes, I repeat, you have deserved well of Progress,
you have deserved well of Humanity; and you have a
right to bear with pride your great scholastic name; for
it was noble to desire the emancipation of woman, of labor,
and of the laborer; it was generous to consecrate
youth and fortune to it, as so many among you have
done.</p>

<p>Through your aspirations, you have been the continuers
of '89, since you dreamed of realizing what was
contained in the germ in the Declaration of Rights:
these are your titles of greatness; this is why your
name will not perish. But if, through your sentiments,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"> 175</a></span>
you belonged to the great era of '89, the social form in
which you claimed to incarnate your principles, belonged
to the Middle Ages; the age therefore has done right
to leave you behind. Seduced by trinitarian mysticism,
deluded by an erroneous historical point of view, you
claimed to resuscitate hierarchy and theocracy in a system
of humanity fashioned in conformity with the opposing
principle; the triumph of individual liberty in
social equality. This is the reason that the age could
not follow you. No more could women follow you, for
they felt that they could only be affranchised through
labor and through purity of morals; by ruling over,
not imitating masculine passions. They felt that their
power of moralization was due as much to their chastity
as to their intellect; they knew that those who make
use of the most liberty in love, neither love nor esteem
the other sex; that, in general, they employ their ascendancy
over it to pervert it to ruin and afflict their
companions, and to dissolve the family and civilization;
that, in consequence, they are the most dangerous enemies
of the emancipation of their sex; for man, sobered
of his passion, can never desire to emancipate those by
whom he has been deceived, ruined and demoralized.</p>

<p>The St. Simonian orthodoxy is therefore, in my opinion,
greatly mistaken with respect to the ways and
means of realization. Shall we impute this to it as a
crime? No, indeed! social problems are not mathematical
problems; there is merit in propounding them;
courage and devotion in pursuing their solution, even
when we fail completely to attain it.</p>

<p>We all know the spirit of the St. Simonians who first
brought before the public mind of the age the question
of female emancipation; it would be ungrateful in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"> 176</a></span>
the women who demand liberty and equality not to recognize
the debt of gratitude which they have contracted
toward them. It is their duty to say to their companions:
the seal of St. Simonianism is the safeguard of the
liberty of woman; wherever therefore you meet a
St. Simonian, you may press his hand fraternally; you
have in him a defender of your right.</p>

<p>Let us sketch the general outline of the St. Simonian
doctrine, touching woman and her rights.</p>

<p>All of the St. Simonians admit that the sexes are
equal;</p>

<p>That the couple forms the social individual;</p>

<p>That marriage is the sacred bond of generations; the
association of a man and a woman for the accomplishment
of a sacerdotal, scientific, artistic, or industrial
work;</p>

<p>All admit divorce, and transition to another union;
but some are more severe than others with respect to
the conditions of divorce.</p>

<p>There is a division among them on the question of
morals. Olinde Rodrigues and Bazard do not admit
any <i>liaison</i> of love outside of marriage. M. Enfantine,
on the contrary, claims the greatest liberty in love.</p>

<p>We should add that he gives to this opinion a fixed
and provisional value only, since he says that the law
of the relations of sexes can only be established in a
sure and definitive manner by the concurrence of the woman;
and since, on the other hand, he prescribes continence
to his closest followers, until the coming of the
Woman, of which he regards himself the precursor.</p>

<p>In addition, to give our readers a more precise idea
of the sentiments of the St. Simonians concerning woman,
we will cite some passages of their writings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"> 177</a></span>
"The use of woman by man still exists," says M.
Enfantin; "<i>this it is that constitutes the necessity of our
apostleship</i>. This use, this subalternation <i>contrary to
nature</i>, with respect to the future, results on the one
hand, in falsehood and fraud; on the other, in violence
and animal passions; it is necessary to put an end to
these vices."&mdash;(<i>Religion St. Simonienne</i>, 1832, p. 5.)</p>

<p>"Woman, as we have said, <i>is the equal of man</i>;
She is now a slave; it belongs to her master to affranchise
her." (<i>Id.</i> p. 12.)</p>

<p>"There will be no definitive law and morality until
woman shall have spoken." (<i>Id.</i> p. 18.)</p>

<p>"In the name of God," exclaims M. Enfantin in his
<i>Appel à la Femme</i>, "in the name of God and of all the
sufferings which Humanity, his loved child, endures to-day
in her flesh; in the name of the poorest and most
numerous class whose daughters are sold to Indolence
and whose sons are given up to War; in the name of
all those men and of all those women, who cast the glittering
veil of falsehood or the filthy rays of debauchery
over their secret or public prostitution; in the name
of St. Simon who came to announce to man and woman
<i>their moral, social and religious equality</i>, I conjure
woman to answer me!" (<i>Entretien du 7 Décembre</i>,
1831.)</p>

<p>On his side, Bazard concludes a pamphlet, published
in January, 1832, with these words:</p>

<p>"And we too have hastened the coming of woman;
we too summon her with all our might; but it is in the
name of the pure love with which she has imbued the
heart of man, and which man is now ready to give her
in return; it is in the name of the dignity which is
promised her in marriage; it is lastly and above all, in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"> 178</a></span>
the name of the most numerous and poorest class, <i>whose
servitudes and humiliations she has hitherto shared</i>, and
whom her enchanting voice can alone to-day have
power finally to release from the harsh imposition with
which it is still weighed down by the wrecks of the
past."</p>

<p>Ah! you are to a great extent right, Enfantin and
Bazard! So long as woman is not free and the equal
of man; so long as she is not everywhere at his side,
sorrows, disorders, war, the exploitation of the weak,
will be the sad lot of humanity.</p>

<p>Pierre Leroux, the gentlest, best and most simple man
that I know, writes in turn in the fourth volume of his
<i>Encyclopédie Nouvelle</i>, article <i>Egalité</i>, the following
remarkable paragraphs:</p>

<p>"There are not two different beings, man and woman,
there is but a single human being with two phases,
which correspond and are united by love.</p>

<p>"Man and woman exist to form the couple; they are
the two parts of it. <i>Outside of the couple, outside of
love and marriage, there is no longer any sex</i>; there
are human beings of a common origin and of like faculties.
Man at every moment of his life is sensation,
sentiment, knowledge; so is woman. The definition
is therefore the same."</p>

<p>After having proved, according to his idea, that the
type of woman differs from that of man, he continues:</p>

<p>"But this type does not separate them from the rest
of humanity, and does not make of them a separate
race which must be distinguished philosophically from
man.... Love being absent, they manifest themselves
to man as human beings, and are ranked, like
man, under the various categories of civil society."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"> 179</a></span>
After having observed that, however different men
may be, they are therefore none the less equal, since
they all are sensation, sentiment and knowledge, Pierre
Leroux, applying this principle to the question of the
right of woman, adds:</p>

<p>"From whatever side we look at this question, we
are led to proclaim the equality of man and woman.
For, if we consider woman in the couple, woman is the
equal of man, since the couple itself is founded on
equality, since love is equality in itself, and since where
justice, that is, equality, does not reign, there love cannot
reign, but the contrary of love.</p>

<p>"And if we consider woman outside of the couple,
she is a being like unto man, endowed with the same faculties
in various degrees; one of those varieties in unity
which constitute the world and human society."</p>

<p>The author says that woman should lay claim to
equality only as a spouse and a human being; that to
acknowledge her as free because she has sex, is to declare
her at liberty not only to use but also to abuse
love; and that the abuse of love must not be the appanage
and sign of liberty.</p>

<p>He says that woman has sex only for him whom
she loves and by whom she is loved; that to all others
she can be merely a human being.</p>

<p>"From this point of view," continues he, "we must
say to women: you have a right to equality by two
distinct titles; as human beings and as wives. As wives,
you are our equals, for love in itself is equality. As
human beings, your cause is that of all, <i>it is the same as
that of the people; it is allied to the great revolutionary
cause</i>; that is, to the general progress of the human
kind. <i>You are our equals, not because you are women
but because there are no longer either slaves or serfs.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"> 180</a></span>
"This is the truth that must be spoken to men and
women; but it would be to pervert this truth and to
transform it into error to say to women: You are a sex
apart, a sex in the possession of love. Emancipate
yourselves; that is, use and abuse love. Woman thus
transformed into an unchaste Venus, loses at once her
dignity as a human being and as a woman; that is, as a
being capable of forming a human couple under the sacred
law of love."</p>

<p>The excellent Leroux asks who does not feel, who
does not admit at the present day the equality of the sexes?</p>

<p>Who would dare maintain that woman is an inferior
being, of whom man is the guide and beacon light?</p>

<p>That woman is elevated by man, who is elevated only
by himself and by God?</p>

<p>Who would dare maintain such absurdities to-day,
brave and upright Leroux? P. J. Proudhon, the man
who called you <i>Theopompe</i> and <i>Pâlissier</i>&mdash;M. Michelet,
who claims that woman was created to be the most tiresome
doll of her loving husband.</p>

<p>But to return to yourself.</p>

<p>You affirm that God is androgynous; that in him coexist
the male and female principles on the footing of
equality: that consequently, man and woman are equal
in God. I assent to this willingly, although I know absolutely
nothing about it. But when you add that woman
is deserving of quite as much as man, because she
has shared in all the agonizing crises of the progressive
education of the human race;</p>

<p>That love, which cannot exist without the woman,
has led us from the law of slavery to that of equality;</p>

<p>That consequently woman represents half in the work
of the ages;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"> 181</a></span>
In this there is no mystery; I join you therefore with
all my heart in repeating to men the invitations and the
lessons which you give to these ungrateful and stubborn
males:</p>

<p>"If we are free, it is in part by woman; let her
then be made free by us.</p>

<p>"But is she so? Is she treated by us as an equal?</p>

<p>"A wife&mdash;does she find equality in love and marriage?</p>

<p>"A human being, does she find equality in the State?</p>

<p>"This is the question.</p>

<p>"On the subject of woman, our civil law is a model
of absurd contradictions. According to the Roman
law, woman lived perpetually under tutelage; in this
system of legislation, everything was at least in perfect
harmony; woman was always a minor. We, on our
part, declare her in a multitude of cases to be free as
man. She is no longer under general or fictitious tutelage;
her age of majority is fixed; she is competent to
inherit in her own right; she inherits in equal proportion;
she controls and disposes of her property; more
than this, in the system of communion of goods between
husband and wife, we admit the separation of property.
But let the marriage bond itself be in question, in
which wealth is no longer at stake, but ourselves and
our mothers, ourselves and our sisters, ourselves and our
daughters; then we are found intractable in our laws;
we no longer admit equality; we require woman to declare
herself our inferior and servant, and to swear obedience
to us.</p>

<p>"Truly we cling more to money than to love; we
have more consideration for money-bags than for human
dignity; for we emancipate women as soon as they become
freeholders; but as soon as they become wives
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"> 182</a></span>
the law declares them our inferiors. Here notwithstanding,
that bond is in question in which the equality of
man and woman is most evident; that bond in which
this equality breaks forth, as it were; that bond in which
it is so necessary to proclaim that without equality, the
bond itself exists no longer. Yet, by an absurd contradiction,
our civil law chooses this moment to proclaim
the inferiority of woman; it condemns her to obedience,
makes her take a false oath, and takes advantage of love
to make it outrage itself.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt that, to future ages, the characteristic
symbol of our moral condition will be that article
of our laws which sanctions in set terms inequality in
love. It will be said of us: they had so little comprehension
of justice, that they did not comprehend love
which is justice in even its holiest type; they had so little
comprehension of love, that they did not even admit
justice in it; and that in their written law, their Code,
the form of marriage, the only sacrament of which they
yet had any idea, instead of sanctioning equality,
sanctions inequality; instead of union, disunion; instead
of the love that equalizes and identifies its objects, some
contradictory and monstrous relation, founded at the
same time upon identity, and upon inferiority and slavery.
Yes, like those forms of the law of the Twelve
Tables, that we quote now to prove the barbarity of the
ancient Romans and their ignorance of justice, this article
of our Code will be some day cited to characterize
our grossness and ignorance, for the absence of an elevated
notion of justice is as marked in it as is the absence
of an elevated notion of love.</p>

<p>"Thence follows everything relative to the condition
of woman; or rather, everything is connected with this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"> 183</a></span>
point; for will we respect the equality of woman as a
human being when we are senseless enough to deny her
this quality as a wife? Is woman to-day, in so far as a
human being, really treated as the equal of man? I
will not enter upon this broad subject. I confine myself
to a single question; what education do women receive?
You treat them as you treat the people. To
these too you leave the old religion that fits us no longer.
They are children kept as long as possible in swaddling
clothes, as though this were not the true way to
deform them, to destroy at once the rectitude of their
mind and the candor of their soul. Besides, what does
Society do for them? To what new careers does she
give them access? Yet, notwithstanding, it is evident
to every thinking mind that our arts, our sciences, our
manufactures will make as much new progress when
women are called to take a part in them, as they did a
few years ago, when they were opened to the serfs.
You complain of the want and wretchedness that
weighs down your systems of society; <i>abolish the castes
that are still subsisting; abolish the caste in which you
hold immured the half of the human race</i>."</p>

<p>These few pages, my readers, give you the compass
of the sentiments of the St. Simonians, both orthodox
and dissenters, and justify the sympathy entertained by
women who have attained <i>majority</i> for those who have
so ardently pleaded their cause.</p>


<p class="subh">FUSIONISTS.</p>

<p>Louis de Tourreil, the revealer of Fusionism, is a
man whom it is impossible to behold without sympathy
or to hear without pleasure; he is kindly, he speaks
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"> 184</a></span>
well, and his ideas are most logically deduced; his principles
once admitted, one is constrained to follow him to
the end.</p>

<p>Tourreil expresses himself in the <i>Revue Philosophique</i>
of May, 1856, on the subject of woman and her
rights, as follows:</p>

<p>"Nature is reduced to three great co-eternal principles
or productive agents of all things. These principles
are:</p>

<p>"The female or passive principle,</p>

<p>"The male or active principle,</p>

<p>"And the mixed or unificative principle, participating
in both, which is called Love.</p>

<p>"God is therefore Female, Male and Androgynous,
in his trinary unity.</p>

<p>"He is simultaneously from all eternity Mother, Father
and Love, instead of being, as the theologians say,
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; three agents of like sex,
incapable of producing anything.</p>

<p>"You will easily conceive, my dear brother, that if
the masculine and the feminine sex hold the same rank
in the Divine Trinity, they will be also found in the
same rank in humanity. The part which the divine
woman plays in Heaven, the human woman will play
on Earth....</p>

<p>"Were he (<i>God</i>) only of the masculine sex, men
would say that the masculine sex alone is noble, and
that woman is created merely for the service of man,
as man is created for that of God. They would even
question whether she had a soul, and would think that
they were doing her a favor in admitting her as something
in life."</p>

<p>After quoting the teachings of the apostle Paul with
respect to woman and marriage, the author continues:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"> 185</a></span>
"Behold, my dear brother, the part which Christianity
assigns to woman. If this doctrine therefore were
followed in every point, and if it ought to be replaced
by no higher one, woman would find herself condemned
in perpetuity to a subalternization humiliating to her nature.</p>

<p>"But Fusionism, which is the doctrine of Salvation for
all, does not permit any one to be sacrificed; for this
reason, woman is the equal of man and man the equal
of woman, as in God, the eternal Mother is the equal
of the eternal Father, and the eternal Father is the
equal of the eternal Mother."</p>

<p>De Tourreil believes that the Mother gives form and
the Father life, two things equally necessary to constitute
the being.</p>

<p>"Since woman is the equal of man in absolute principle,"
continues he, "and since she is co-eternal with
him, there is injustice in subordinating her to man in
the relative; and the book of <i>Genesis</i> commits a gross
error in making her proceed from man:</p>

<p>"If either of the two could be before the other, it
would be the woman, for strictly speaking, we could
conceive of the being without the life, but it would be
quite impossible to conceive of the life without the being:
The being without the life would be a dead being, but
what would the life be without the being? It would
be a life without existence, negation, the absence of life,
nothingness. Therefore, in logical order, woman is
first....</p>

<p>"Not only ought woman to be the equal of man, as
we have seen, but in enunciation and classification,
she should be named and classed first.</p>

<p>"Woman is the mould by which the species is perfected
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"> 186</a></span>
or depraved, according as the mould is good or
bad. The fate of humanity depends therefore on woman,
since she has all powerful influence on the fruit
that she bears in her bosom.</p>

<p>"Pure, good, intelligent, she will produce healthy,
intelligent and good beings.</p>

<p>"Impure, narrow, and wicked, she will produce unhealthy,
unintelligent and wicked beings.</p>

<p>"In a word, the child will be what its mother is, for
nothing can give what it has not.</p>

<p>"It is important therefore that woman should be developed
like man, that her education should be comprehensive,
that her person should be honored, respected,
and tenderly cared for, in order that nothing in the social
surroundings may shape it to evil.</p>

<p>"Destined by the Supreme Being to form the human
being from her flesh, her blood and her soul, destined to
nourish it with her milk and to give it its earliest education,
the two acts which have the greatest influence
over the individual life, woman should be considered as
the chief agent of perfection. This <i>rôle</i> classes her
naturally in a very elevated rank in society, and exacts
of her superior perfections.</p>

<p>"Thus in the future she will be the image of Divine
Wisdom on earth, as man will represent Divine Power.</p>

<p>"To man more especially will belong action; to woman,
counsel.</p>

<p>"Man will take the initiative in difficult enterprises;
woman will moderate or excite ardor therein.</p>

<p>"Man will rule the planet; woman will embellish it.</p>

<p>"Man will symbolize science and manufactures; woman
will symbolize poetry and art.</p>

<p>"The one will always have need of the other; they
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"> 187</a></span>
will walk together side by side, and will find completeness
reciprocally in each other.</p>

<p>"Such, my dear friend, after a brief fashion, is the
idea which should be formed of woman. Man and woman
are not two beings radically separated; both together
make but a single being. To subordinate woman
to man or man to woman is therefore to mutilate the
human being, or to fail to comprehend its interests.
That humanity may be happy, neither of its halves
must suffer. And how can it help suffering if it is reduced
to servitude and oppressed by the other?</p>

<p>"Our destiny on earth is to constitute the collective
being in his own consciousness. For this, it is necessary
to realize the humanitary androgynus. Now the
humanitary androgynus necessitates first the individual
androgynus which can only be constituted by harmonious
marriage.</p>

<p>"Marriage is therefore the great formative or deformative
law of the collective being, according as it is expressed
by the legislator in a manner conformably or
contrary to human destiny.</p>

<p>"It is in marriage that the sources of good and evil
are found; would you know why?</p>

<p>"Because in the act that joins the man to the woman,
and by which the couple are made to form but one
body, the two souls are fused by means of a reciprocal
donation, which unites the souls of the two for eternity.</p>

<p>"So that, after the conjunction, the soul of the woman
adheres to the soul of the man and accompanies it
everywhere, while the soul of the man adheres to the
woman and never more quits it.</p>

<p>"Whence it follows that if the soul of the man be depraved,
it depraves the woman to whom it is united, by
exercising over her a continued action, even at a distance.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"> 188</a></span>
So also does the depravity of the woman united
to the man deprave him without his knowing it by an
occult and permanent action.</p>

<p>"The souls of two depraved beings may be therefore
inseparably conjoined, without thus constituting the
individual androgynus, which is the divine end of marriage
or the union of the sexes.</p>

<p>"The individual androgynus is only possible to the
condition of unity. But unity cannot be constituted by
evil.</p>

<p>"The good, the true and the perfect alone can combine
the conditions of unity. The evil, the false and
the imperfect are essentially inharmonious in their nature.</p>

<p>"Two wicked, insincere and vicious beings will only
produce by their conjunction a still greater difference.
They will be united, but only reciprocally to torment
each other. Unity will never be constituted by them;
and without the constitution of unity or the individual
androgynus, it will be impossible to realize the human
destiny.</p>

<p>"In order that the individual androgynus may exist in
the couple, there must be perfect spiritual communion
between them; that is, communion of thought, of feeling,
and of will. But how can two individuals who, instead
of being ruled by truth, are ruled only by their
misdirected passions,&mdash;how can these two make but
one? It is impossible.</p>

<p>"You will comprehend, my dear brother, from these
few words, how sacred is marriage, and how important
it is to contract none but harmonious unions, for the unhappiness
of a lifetime often depends on an inconsiderate
conjunction."</p>

<p>Having had several opportunities of meeting M. de
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"> 189</a></span>
Tourreil, I asked him for some exact details in respect
to the liberty of woman and marriage.</p>

<p>The following is an abstract of those that he has
kindly given me;</p>

<p>Education should be the same for both sexes;</p>

<p>Woman should be at liberty to follow the vocation
which comes to her from God; and of which she alone
is judge;</p>

<p>"In all grades and employments in the republic of
God, woman should be at the side of man;</p>

<p>After the age of fifty, all individuals of both sexes
should be rulers and priests;</p>

<p>The reproduction of the species being the work of
the love of persons healthy in mind and in body, before
marriage, the bride should be required to make confession
to a priestess and the bridegroom to a priest, in
order to be enlightened with respect to the opportuneness
or unsuitableness of the union.</p>

<p>Dissolution of marriage should take place but in a
single case,&mdash;when the husband and wife have attained
to complete fusion; that is, to feeling and knowing reciprocally
that they have no longer anything to exchange.
It then becomes necessary to form new ties,
and, each one to labor to fuse with a new consort. In
the existing condition of humanity, this fusion cannot
take place; but in the future, when we shall be nearer
perfection, it will become possible several times in life.</p>

<p>Fusionism is, as is evident, mystical socialism.</p>

<p>Its votaries are gentle and good, and very tolerant
towards those who do not think like them.</p>

<p class="subh">PHALANSTERIANS.</p>

<p>The motto of the Fourieristic, Societary or Phalansterian
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"> 190</a></span>
school is <i>respect for individual liberty</i>, based on the
following notions:</p>

<p>All nature is good; it becomes perverted only when
performing its functions in evil surroundings.</p>

<p>No person exactly resembling the rest, each one should
be the sole judge of his capacities, and should receive
laws only from himself.</p>

<p>Attractions are proportional to destinies.</p>

<p>If the disciples of my compatriot, Charles Fourier,
do not express themselves exactly in this wise, all that
have written bears the imprint of these thoughts.</p>

<p>Are Fourier and his disciples right in believing that
the law of passional attraction <i>alone</i> is required to organize
the industrial, moral and social world?</p>

<p>That the primordial element of a system of society
should be the Societary or Phalansterian association?</p>

<p>That the most opposite, the most diverse passions are
the conditions <i>sine quâ non</i> of harmony?</p>

<p>That the compensation of labor and of competition
should be regulated according to Labor, Capital
and Talent?</p>

<p>We are not called on to examine this here.</p>

<p>The only thing that need occupy us in this rapid review
of contemporaneous opinions is the investigation
of the sentiments and ideas of Fourier and his school
in that which concerns the principal object of this book.
A few pages from the chief of the order, and a summary
analysis will suffice for this.</p>

<p>In the <i>Théorie des quatre Mouvements</i>, M. Fourier
writes;</p>

<p>"That the ancient philosophers of Greece and Rome
should have disdained the interests of women is by no
means surprising, since these rhetoricians were all ultra
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"> 191</a></span>
partisans of the pederasty which they had brought in
high honor in <i>la belle antiquité</i>. They cast ridicule
upon the associating with women; this passion was
considered dishonorable.... These manners obtained
the unanimous suffrage of the philosophers who, from
the virtuous Socrates to the delicate Anacreon, affected
Sodomitish love alone and contempt for women,
who were banished to the upper apartments, immured
as in a seraglio, and exiled from the society of men.</p>

<p>"These fantastic tastes not having found favor among
the moderns, there is reason for surprise that our philosophers
should have inherited the hatred that the ancient
scholars bore to women, and that they should continue
to disparage the sex on account of a few wiles to
which woman is forced by the oppression which weighs
upon her; for every word or thought in conformity with
the voice of nature is made in her a crime.</p>

<p>"What can be more inconsistent than the opinion of
Diderot, who pretends that, to write to woman, one
has only to dip his pen in the rainbow, and sprinkle the
writing with dust from butterflies' wings? Women
might reply to the philosopher: Your civilization persecutes
us as soon as we obey nature; we are obliged
to assume a fictitious character and to listen to impulses
contrary to our desires. To give us a relish for this
doctrine, you are forced to bring in play deceitful illusions
and language, as you do with respect to the soldier
whom you cradle in laurels and immortality to divert
his thoughts from his wretched condition. If he
were truly happy, he would welcome the plain and
truthful language which you take care not to address
to him. It is the same with women; if they were
free and happy, they would be less eager for illusions
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"> 192</a></span>
and cajoleries, and it would no longer be necessary
in writing to them to place rainbows and butterflies'
wings under contribution.</p>

<p>"When it (Philosophy) rails at the vices of women,
it criticises itself; this it is that produces these vices by
a social system which, repressing their faculties from
their infancy and through the whole course of their life,
forces them to have recourse to fraud in order to yield
to nature.</p>

<p>"To attempt to judge of women by the vicious character
which they display in civilization is like attempting
to judge of human nature by the character of the
Russian peasant, who is destitute of all ideas of honor
and liberty; or like judging the beaver by the stupidity
which they show when domesticated, whilst in a condition
of liberty combined with labor, they become the
most intelligent of all quadrupeds. The same contrast
will reign between the women who are slaves of civilization
and those who are free in the combined order;
they will surpass men in industrial devotion, in loyalty,
in nobleness; but outside of the free and combined
state, woman, like the domesticated beaver or the Russian
peasant, becomes a being so inferior to her destiny
and talents that we are inclined to despise her when
judging her superficially according to appearances.</p>

<p>"It is a surprising thing that women should have always
shown themselves superior to men when they have
had it in their power to display on the throne their natural
talents, of which the diadem assured them a free
use. Is it not certain that of eight queens, independent
and unmarried, seven will be found to have reigned
with glory, while of eight kings, we count habitually
seven feeble sovereigns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"> 193</a></span>
... The Elizabeths and Catherines did not
make war in person, but they knew how to choose their
generals; and it is enough that these are good. In
every other branch of administration, has not woman
given lessons to man? What prince has surpassed in
firmness Maria Theresa who, in a disastrous moment,
when the fidelity of her subjects was tottering and her
ministers were struck with terror, undertook herself
alone to inspire all with new courage? She intimidated
by her presence, the disaffected Diet of Hungary;
she harangued the Magnates in the Latin tongue, and
brought her very enemies to swear on their sabres to die
for her. This is an indication of the prodigies that
would be wrought by feminine emulation in a social order
which would permit free scope to her faculties.</p>

<p>"And you, the oppressing sex,&mdash;would you not go beyond
the faults imputed to women if you, like them,
had been moulded by a servile education to believe
yourselves automatons created to obey prejudices and to
cringe before the master whom chance had given you?
Have we not seen your pretensions to superiority confounded
by Catharine, who trampled under foot the
masculine sex? In creating titled favorites, she trailed
man in the dust, and proved that it is possible for him
in full liberty to abase himself beneath woman, whose
degradation is forced, and consequently, excusable.
It would be necessary, to confound the tyranny of man
that, for the space of a century, a third sex should exist,
which should be both male and female, and stronger
than man. This new sex would prove by dint of blows
that men as well as women were made for its pleasures;
then we should hear men protest against the tyranny of
the hermaphrodite sex, and confess that force ought not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"> 194</a></span>
to be the sole law of right. Now why are these privileges,
this independence, which they would reclaim
from this third sex, refused by them to women.</p>

<p>"In singling out those women who have had power to
soar, from the virago, like Maria Theresia, to those of a
gentler type, like the Ninons and the Sévignés, I am authorized
in saying that woman, in a state of liberty, will
surpass man in all functions of the mind and body
which are not the attributes of physical strength.</p>

<p>"Man seems already to foresee this; he becomes indignant
and alarmed when women give the lie to the
prejudice that accuses them of inferiority. <i>Masculine
jealousy has especially broken out against women authors;
philosophy has kept them out of academic honors,
and has sent them back ignominiously to the household.</i>"...
(p. 148.)</p>

<p>"What is their existence to-day (that of women)?
They exist in privations alone, even in the trades, in
which man has encroached on everything, <i>even to the
minutest occupations of the needle and the pen, while
women are seen employed in the toilsome labors of the
field. Is it not scandalous to see athletes thirty years
old squatted before a desk, or carrying a cup of coffee
with muscular arms</i>, as if there were not women and
children enough to attend to the minor details of the
counting-room and the household.</p>

<p>"What then are the means of subsistence for women
destitute of fortune? The distaff, or else their charms
if they have any. <i>Yes, prostitution more or less glossed
over is their only resource</i>, which philosophy
again contests to them; this is the abject fate to which
they are reduced by this civilization, this conjugal slavery
which they have not even thought of attacking."
(p. 150.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"> 195</a></span>
Fourier bitterly reproaches women authors for having
neglected to seek the means whereby to put an end to
such a state of affairs, and adds with great reason:</p>

<p>"Their indolence in this respect is one of the causes
that have accrued from the contempt of man. <i>The
slave is never more contemptible than by a blind submission
which persuades the oppressor that his victim
was born for slavery.</i>, (p. 150)."</p>

<p>Fourier is right, but ... to elevate others is to risk
being lost one's self in the crowd; and every one is not
capable of this degree of abnegation.</p>

<p>To combat for the right of the weak when men have
admitted you to their ranks, is to prepare for yourself a
rough way and a heavy cross.</p>

<p>In the first place, you are exposed to the hatred and
raillery of men, then half-cultured women corroded by
jealousy, invent a thousand calumnies for your destruction;
they feign to be scandalized that a woman dare
protest against the inferiority and use of her sex; they
enter into league with the masters, clamor louder than
they and satirize you without mercy.</p>

<p>Now all women are not made to shrug their shoulders
in the face of this cohort of morbid minds ... they love
peace too well, they lack courage, and <i>they do not care
enough for justice</i>; is it not so, ladies?</p>

<p>Let us return to Fourier. It is known that he admits
several social periods. According to him, the
pivot of each of them hinges on love and the degree
of liberty of woman.</p>

<p>"As a general rule," he says, "<i>social progress and
changes of the period will be wrought in proportion to
the progress of women towards liberty, and the decay
of the social order will be wrought in proportion to the
decline of the liberty of women</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"> 196</a></span>
In another place, he adds in speaking of philosophers:</p>

<p>"If they treat of morals, they forget to recognize
and to claim the rights of the weaker sex, <i>the oppression
of which destroys the basis of justice</i>."</p>

<p>He says again, elsewhere:</p>

<p>"Now, God recognizes as liberty only that which is
extended to both sexes, and not to one alone; so he has
prescribed that all the germs of social evils, as the
savage state, barbarism, civilization, should have no
other pivot than the enthrallment of women; and that
all the germs of social good, as the sixth, seventh and
eighth period, should have no other pivot, no other compass,
than the progressive affranchisement of the weaker
sex."</p>

<p>Fourier is reproached with having desired the emancipation
of woman in love; nothing is more true. But
to impute this to him as immorality, men must censure
their own morals. Now, these gentlemen considering
themselves as wholly <i>pure</i>, though themselves representing
the <i>butterfly</i> in love, infidelity and the simultaneous
possession of several women being only a pastime
to them, I do not really see what they can blame in
Fourier.</p>

<p>Either what they do is right, and therefore cannot be
wrong in woman;</p>

<p>Or what they do is wrong; then why do they do it?</p>

<p>Fourier believed in the unity of the moral law and
in the equality of the sexes; he believed in the lawfulness
of the morals of these gentlemen, <i>minus perfidy
and hypocrisy</i>; this is the reason that he claims emancipation
in love for woman: he is logical.</p>

<p>Besides, he repeats continually that the ethics that he
depicts would cause disorder in the civilized period;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"> 197</a></span>
and that they can only be established progressively in
subsequent periods. Many among the Phalansterians
reject Fourier's ethics with respect to love as well as his
Theodicy, and I myself have heard several discourses
in which the orator condemned, not only falsity in conjugal
relations, but also looseness of morals.</p>

<p>Fourier and the Saint Simonian orthodoxy have both
been guilty of the same error with regard to the emancipation
of woman; but, men, I repeat, must be very
audacious to impute it to them as a crime, since they
indulge themselves in worse; as to women, sustained
and loved by these reformers, let them imitate the pious
conduct of Shem and Japhet; one owes respect to his
father, whatever may be the idea or the wine with
which he is drunken.</p>

<p>Now that we have cited the master, let us enumerate
the principal points of the Fourierist doctrine, touching
the liberty of woman and the equality of the sexes:</p>

<p>1. Man and woman are composed of the same physical,
moral and intellectual elements; there is, therefore,
between the sexes, identity of nature.</p>

<p>2. The proportion of these elements differs in the
two sexes, and constitutes the difference that exists between
them.</p>

<p>3. This difference is so equalized that the value
shall be equal. Where man is the stronger, he takes
precedence of woman; where woman is stronger, she
takes precedence of man.</p>

<p>4. Man belongs to the <i>major mode</i>: he has the ascendency
over woman in intellect, in logic, in the larger
manufactures, in friendship; it belongs to him therefore
to create positive science, to connect facts, to regulate
commercial relations, to bind together interests, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"> 198</a></span>
to organize groups and series. To all these things, woman
brings her indispensable aid, but by reason of her
aptitudes, her services are only secondary therein.</p>

<p>5. Woman belongs to the <i>minor mode</i>; she has the
ascendency over man in the kind of intellect that applies
and adapts, in the intuition that puts man on the
track of the good to which masculine logic should attain;
in the sphere of maternity in which she presides
over education, for she comprehends the means to be
employed to ameliorate the species in every respect better
than man; in the sphere of love in which she has
the right and the power to civilize and refine the relations
of the sexes; and to stimulate man to conquest of
the intellect, to the amelioration of the physical conditions
of the globe, of industry, of art, of social relations,
etc.</p>

<p>Woman intervenes to a certain point in the major
mode, so does man enter into the minor mode, in which
his coöperation is indispensable.</p>

<p>Thus, in general, in man the head predominates, in
woman, the heart; but as both have a heart and a head,
man, through his heart, becomes an aid in the minor
mode, and woman, through her head, becomes an aid in
the major mode.</p>

<p>6. There are men who are women both in head and
in heart; women who are men both in heart and in head;
in humanity they form the eighth of an exception. Full
liberty and right are granted to them.</p>

<p>7. Each member of the Phalanstery follows his vocation,
obeys his attractions, <i>for attractions are proportional
to destinies</i>. Therefore the eighth of an exception
in both sexes, having an attraction towards labors
that belong more especially to the other sex, is at liberty
to yield to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"> 199</a></span>
8. All major men and women have an equal vote.</p>

<p>9. All matters are regulated by chiefs <i>of both sexes</i>,
chosen by the free vote of both sexes.</p>

<p>10. All offices, from the presidency of the group to
that of the globe, are filled jointly by men and women,
who divide between them the details of this common
function.</p>

<p>11. The mother is the instructress of her children;
they belong to her alone; the father has no rights over
them unless the mother chooses to confer these on him.</p>

<p>Such is the summary of the Fourierist doctrine on the
subject of which we treat.</p>

<p>If the Societary School has not reached perfect truth,
it must be at least acknowledged that it has taken the
right way to attain it. Whether its theory of the classification
and the predominance of faculties in conformity
with the sexes be exact or not, the error will not be
productive of mischievous results in practice. Woman
being free to follow her aptitudes, being half in rights
and functions, could always place herself in the exceptional
eighth, without fear of encountering jealous individuals,
better fitted than herself to warble in the minor
key, who would send her back to the duties of the
household.</p>

<p>I remember, in this connection, a certain advocate,
by no means <i>feminine</i>, professing a superb disdain of
the sex to which his mother belonged, worthy in a
word, to be the disciple of P. J. Proudhon; would you
know what this man had retained of all his lessons in
law? The art of sweeping a room properly, of polishing
furniture, of hemming napkins and pocket handkerchiefs
neatly, and of compounding sauces. Do you not
think, illustrious Proudhon, that he might have been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"> 200</a></span>
advised with more justice to <i>go and iron his collars</i>, than
certain women who write good articles on Philosophy.</p>

<p>But let us return to Fourier.</p>

<p>Among the Socialist Schools, that of Fourier occupies
a distinguished place; it is the one most deserving
of the gratitude of women through the principles that
it has laid down. Be it understood, we separate in this
connection the principles of Liberty and Equality from
all that relates to the question of ethics, which we cannot
resolve in the same manner as Fourier, <i>any more
for woman than man</i>.</p>

<p><span class="cap">C</span><span class="smallc">OMMUNIST.</span> The two sexes differ, do not perform
the same functions, but <i>they are equal before the law</i>.</p>

<p>For woman to be really emancipated, society must be
remoulded economically, and marriage suppressed.</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">HILADELPHIAN AND</span> <span class="cap">I</span><span class="smallc">CARIAN.</span> We are of your opinion,

and oppressed woman, it has been because, in its sight,
she represented matter, the world, evil. We, who are
come to give the true meaning of the Trinity, rehabilitate
or explain what our predecessors have condemned.
Woman is the equal of man, because in God, who comprises
everything, matter is equal to spirit. With man,
woman forms the couple which is the social individual,
the functionary. As woman is very different from
man, we do not take the liberty of judging her; we
content ourselves with <i>summoning</i> her that she may reveal
herself.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding we think that she can only be affranchised
by being emancipated in love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"> 202</a></span>
<span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">IERRE</span> <span class="cap">L</span><span class="smallc">EROUX</span> <i>agitated</i>. Take care! It is not so
much in sex that woman should be affranchised; it is
only in her quality of <i>wife and human being</i>. She has
sex only for him she loves; to all other men she is what
they are themselves: sensation, sentiment, sense. She
must be free in marriage and in the commonwealth as
man himself should be.</p>

<p><span class="cap">F</span><span class="smallc">USIONIST</span> <i>interrupting him</i>. You are right, Pierre
Leroux; yet neither is the previous speaker wholly
wrong; woman is free and the equal of man in
everything, because spirit and matter are equal in God;
because the man and the woman form together the human
androgynus, the derivation of the divine androgynus.
It is not so, my dear sister?</p>

<p><span class="cap">M</span><span class="smallc">YSELF.</span> Excuse me, brothers, from joining in your
theological discussion; my wings are not strong enough
to follow you into the bosom of God, in order to assure
myself whether he is spirit or matter, androgynus or
not, binary, trinary, quarternary, or nothing of all
these. It is enough for me that you all grant that woman
should be free, and the equal of man.</p>

<p>I permit myself only a single observation; that your
notion of the couple or of the androgynus, at the bottom
one and the same thing, tends fatally to the subjugation
of my sex; if, by a metaphor, a fiction, we make of
two beings, endowed each with a separate will, free-will
and intellect, a single unity; <i>in social practice</i>, this
unity is manifested by a single will, a single free-will, a
single intellect, and the individuality that prevails in
our society is that which is endowed with strength of
arm; the other is annihilated, and the right given
to the couple is in reality only the right of the stronger.
The use that M. Proudhon has made of androgyny
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"> 203</a></span>
ought to cure you of this fancy; as the use which
your predecessors made of the ternary ought to have
preserved you from trinitary metaphysics. Be it said
without offence to you, gentlemen, I have a decided antipathy
to any trinities and androgynies whatsoever; I
am a sworn enemy to all metaphysics, whether profane
or sacred,&mdash;a constitutional vice, aggravated in me by
Kant and his school.</p>

<p><span class="cap">P</span><span class="smallc">HALANSTERIAN.</span> For God's sake, gentlemen, let us
quit this mysticism. Man and woman are different, but
the one is as necessary as the other to the great work that
should be accomplished by humanity; therefore they are
equal. As each individual has a right to develop himself
integrally, to manifest himself completely in order
to perform the parcellary task which his attractions assign
to him, the liberty of one sex can no more be called
in question than can that of the other. Man modulates
in major, woman in minor, with an exceptional eighth;
but, as in all the general functions, the combination of
the two modes is necessary, it is evident that each of
them ought to be double, and that woman ought everywhere
to be equal with man.</p>

<p><span class="cap">M.</span><span class="smallc">DE</span> <span class="cap">G</span><span class="smallc">IRARDIN</span> <i>somewhat abruptly</i>. Gentlemen,
I agree with you that woman ought to be free and
equal with man; only I maintain that her function is
to manage, to economize, and to rear her children, while
man labors and brings into the household the product
of his industry.</p>

<p>As I wish woman to be freed from servitude and all
children to be rendered legitimate, I suppress civil marriage,
and institute universal dowry.</p>

<p><span class="cap">M. L</span><span class="smallc">EGOUVE</span> <i>smiling</i>. You go too fast and too far,
my dear sir, you will frighten everybody. At least, I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"> 204</a></span>
believe like you in the equality of the sexes through
the equivalence of their functions, but I take good care
not to breathe a word of it. I content myself with
claiming for woman instruction, diminution of conjugal
servitude, and offices of charity; counting, between
ourselves, that these victories obtained, women will be
in a position through their education and proved utility,
to affranchise themselves completely. Well! despite
my reserve and moderation, you see that some call me
<i>effeminate</i>, others <i>sans culotte</i>.</p>

<p><span class="cap">M. M</span><span class="smallc">ICHELET</span>, <i>rising with tears in his eyes</i>. Alas,
gentlemen, you are all in the wrong road; and I am
very sorry, my beloved academician Legouvé, to see
you employ your elegant pen in leading woman in so
perilous and irrational a way.</p>

<p>As to you, gentlemen, who lay claim to liberty and
equality of rights for woman, you are not authorized by
her to do so; she demands no right, what should she do
with it&mdash;a being always feeble, always sick, always
wounded. Poor creature! What can be her rôle here
below, if not to be adored by her husband, whose duty it
is to constitute himself her instructor, her physician, her
confessor, her sick nurse, her waiting-maid; to keep her
in a hot-house, and with all these multiplied cares to earn
beside the daily bread; for woman cannot, ought not to
work; she is the love and the altar of the heart of man.</p>

<p>Some among you have dared utter the vile word:
Divorce.</p>

<p>No divorce! The woman who has given herself
away, has received the imprint of man. You should
not abandon her, however guilty she may be. I thought
in the beginning that after your death she ought to
wear mourning to the tomb, beyond which, she and her
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"> 205</a></span>
husband would be fused into the unity of love. But I
have thought better of it; you may appoint a successor.</p>

<p>While Michelet is seating himself, wiping his eyes,
the lid of a coffin is seen to rise, and Comte exclaims
in a sepulchral tone:</p>

<p><i>Worthily</i> and <i>admirably</i> spoken, illustrious professor!</p>

<p>What! you here? exclaims the assembly. Then
one does not perish entirely, as you taught your disciples?</p>

<p><span class="cap">C</span><span class="smallc">OMTE.</span> No, gentlemen, and I was very agreeably
surprised to see myself mistaken. But it is not to instruct
you about the life beyond the tomb that I return;
that would not have been worth the trouble of disturbing
myself. It is to express to the great professor
Michelet all the satisfaction that I feel in seeing him so
richly poetise the ideal that I set up, and strew so
many flowers over the <i>admirable</i> maxim of Aristotle
and the <i>commandment</i> of the great St. Paul.</p>

<p>Yes, thrice illustrious Master, you have rightly said:
woman is made for man, she should obey him, be devoted
to him; she is only a doll in private life, absolutely nothing
in public life. Yes, men should labor for her;
yes, marriage is indissoluble; all this is irreproachable.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UGUSTE</span> <span class="cap">C</span><span class="smallc">OMTISM.</span> I regret but one thing&mdash;that you
have not preserved the ejaculatory orisons of the wife to
the husband, and of the husband to the wife; it would
have been a good example and have made a fine effect
to see them every morning kneeling face to face, with
clasped hands and closed eyes. I hope that this is only
forgetfulness, and that you will reëstablish this detail in
your next edition. I congratulate you openly on the
happy thought that you have conceived of justifying the
absorption of woman by man by aid of a wound and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"> 206</a></span>
mysteries of impregnation; this will have a great effect
on the ignorant.</p>

<p>Rebellious women, and the madmen <i>with corrupt
hearts</i> who sustain them, say that you are a poetic and
ingenuous egotist, that our beloved Proudhon is a brutal
egotist; that I am an egotist by A + B. Let them
say so; I approve and bless you."</p>

<p>The apparition was preparing to lie down again in
his coffin when, having a passion for encountering phantoms,
I seized a corner of his winding sheet, and, notwithstanding
an unequivocal sign from him of <i>vade
retro</i>, I had the courage to represent humbly to the
defunct high priest that the brow of M. Proudhon deserved
quite as much to be blessed as that of M. Michelet.
The defunct gravely crossed his fleshless fore finger
and thumb over the haughty and irreverent head of
the great critic, who neither bowed nor seemed infinitely
flattered.</p>

<p>It being his turn to speak, Proudhon rose and said:
"Gentlemen Communists, Philadelphians, Fusionists,
Phalansterians, Saint Simonians, and you, MM. Girardin
and Legouvé, as well as all of your adherents, you
are all <i>effeminate</i>, men <i>hardened in absurdity</i>.</p>

<p>"If my friend Michelet has gilded, perfumed and sugared
the pill for you, I cannot imitate his address and
moderation, for you know that in temperament I, P. J.
Proudhon, am neither tender nor poetical. Permit me
then roughly to tell you the truth concerning a question
<i>of which you do not understand the first word</i>.</p>

<p>"The Church, St. Thomas d'Aquinas, St. Bonaventure,
St. Paul, and Auguste Comte, as well as the Romans,
the Greeks, Manu and Mahomet teach that woman
is made for the pleasure and use of man, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"> 207</a></span>
she should be subjected to him; now I have sufficiently
established these great truths by affirmations without
reply. It is demonstrated to-day, therefore, to all who
believe in me that woman is a passive being, having the
germ of nothing, who owes everything to man, and
that, consequently, she belongs to him as the work to
the workman. Lest my solution might appear somewhat
harsh to you, or to savor too much of antiquity of
the Middle Ages, I have borrowed of the modern innovators
their farce of Androgyny; I have made the
couple the organ of Justice; in this couple, woman,
transformed by man, becomes a triple deity, a domestic
idol, subject in everything to her priest. I shut her
up in the household, and permit her to have only the
superintendence of festivals and spectacles, the education
of children and maidens, etc.</p>

<p>"Is it not evident, gentlemen, that woman, because
she is weaker than we, is, <i>by justice</i>, condemned to obey
us, and that <i>her liberty consists in experiencing no
amorous emotion, even for her husband</i>? Is it not evident,
in consequence, that you, who do not think as I,
are <i>effeminate, absurd</i> men, and that the women who are
no more willing to be slaves than we were in '89 are <i>insurgents,
impure women whom sin has rendered mad</i>?"</p>

<p>The majority of the assembly laugh; De Girardin
shrugs his shoulders; Legouvé bites his lip in order
not to laugh; Michelet appears troubled at this sally
which may spoil everything. As, in uttering the
word <i>insurgent</i>, the orator glances at me with marked
design, I cannot help saying "yes, I deserve the name
of <i>insurgent</i> like our fathers of '89. As to you, if you
do not amend, I fear greatly that I shall see you die
duly confessed and blessed with extreme unction ...
and you will have well deserved it!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"> 208</a></span>
Now, gentlemen, let us ascertain the vote of your
honorable assembly.</p>

<p>Four schools,&mdash;the Communists, the St. Simonians,
the Fusionians and the Phalansterians,&mdash;with one publicist,
M. de Girardin, who makes as much noise by
himself alone as a whole school, are for the liberty of
woman and the equality of the sexes.</p>

<p>MM. Comte, Proudhon and Michelet are against the
liberty of women and the equality of the sexes.</p>

<p>M. Legouvé and his innumerable adherents wish liberty
for woman, and desire that she should labor to become
equal to man through equivalence of functions.</p>

<p>Which means that the great majority of those <i>who
think</i> are, in different degrees, for our emancipation.</p>

<p>Now that my readers are acquainted with your several
opinions, gentlemen, it belongs to me, a woman, to
speak myself in behalf of my right, without leaning on
anything but Justice and Reason.</p>

<span class="medium">I.</span></p>
</div>

<p>What arguments do the adversaries of the emancipation
of women use to refute the equality of the rights
of the sexes?</p>

<p>Some, theosophists of the old school, claim that one
half of humanity is condemned by God himself to submit
to the other half, because, they say, the first woman
sinned.</p>

<p>Not wishing to depart from the firm ground of justice,
reason and proved facts, we will not argue with
this class of adversaries.</p>

<p>Others, who claim to be imbued with the modern
spirit, and pretend to be disciples of the doctrines of
liberty, condemn woman to inferiority and obedience
because, they say, she is weaker physically and intellectually
than man;</p>

<p>Because she performs functions of an inferior order;</p>

<p>Because she produces less than man in an industrial
point of view;</p>

<p>Because her peculiar temperament prevents her from
performing certain functions;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"> 212</a></span>
Because she is only fit for in-door life; because her
vocation is to be mother and housewife, to devote herself
entirely to her husband and children;</p>

<p>Because man protects and supports her;</p>

<p>Because man is her proxy, and exercises rights both
for her and himself;</p>

<p>Because woman has no more time than capacity to
exercise certain rights.</p>

<p>The rights of woman are in her beauty and our love,
add some, gallantly.</p>

<p>Woman does not claim her rights; many women
themselves are scandalized by the demands made by a
few of their sex, continue other men.</p>

<p>And they spare the courageous women who plead
the cause of right, and the men who sustain them
neither calumnies, nor mockery, nor insult, hoping to
intimidate the former and disgust the latter.</p>

<p>Vain hope! the time in which we could be intimidated
has gone by. If it is justifiable to fear the opinion
of those whom we deem juster and more intelligent than
ourselves, it would be folly to be disturbed by those
whose irrationality and injustice we feel able to demonstrate.</p>

<p>This double demonstration we are about to attempt,
taking up one by one the arguments of these gentlemen.</p>

<p>1. Woman cannot have the same rights as man, because
she is inferior to him in intellectual faculties, you
say. From this proposition, we have a right to conclude
that you consider the <i>human faculties as the basis
of right</i>;</p>

<p>That, the law proclaiming equality of right for your
sex, you are all equal in qualities, all alike strong and
alike intelligent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"> 213</a></span>
That, lastly, no woman is as strong and as intelligent
as you; I cannot say, as the least among you, since, if
right is founded on qualities, as it is equal, your qualities
must be equal.</p>

<p>Now gentlemen, what becomes of these pretensions
in the presence of <i>facts</i> that show you all unequal in
strength and in intellect? What becomes of these pretensions
in the presence of <i>facts</i> that show us a host of women
stronger than many men; a host of women more
intelligent than the great mass of men?</p>

<p>Being unequal in strength and in intellect, and notwithstanding
declared equal in right, it is evident therefore
that you have not founded right on qualities.</p>

<p>And if you have not taken these qualities into account
when your right has been in question, why then do
you talk so loudly of them when the question is that of
the right of woman.</p>

<p>If the faculties were the basis of right, as the faculties
are unequal, the right would be unequal; and, to
be just, it would be necessary to accord right to those
who made good their claims to the necessary faculties
and to exclude the rest; by this standard many women
would be chosen and an infinite number of men excluded.
See where we end when we have not the intellectual
energy to take principles into consideration! You
have but one means of evicting us of equality; namely,
to prove that we do not belong to the same species as
you.</p>

<p>2. Woman, you add, cannot have the same rights as
man because, as mother and housewife, she performs
only functions of an inferior order.</p>

<p>From this second proposition, we have a right to conclude
that <i>functions are the basis of right</i>;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"> 214</a></span>
That your functions are equivalent, since your right is
equal!</p>

<p>That the functions of woman are not equivalent to
those of man.</p>

<p>You have to prove then, gentlemen, that the functions
<i>individually</i> performed by each of you are equivalent;
that, for example, Cuvier, Geoffroy St. Hilaire,
Arago, Fulton, Jacquard, and other inventors and
scholars have not done more, are not doing more for humanity
and civilization than an equal number of manufacturers
of pins' heads.</p>

<p>You have to prove next that the labors of maternity,
those of the household to which the workman owes his
life, his health, his strength, the possibility of accomplishing
his task&mdash;that these functions without which
there would be no humanity, are not equivalent; that is,
as useful to the social body as those of the manufacturer
of jewels or of toys.</p>

<p>You have to prove lastly that the functions of the
female teacher, merchant, book keeper, clerk, dressmaker,
milliner, cook, waiting-maid, etc., are not
equivalent to those of the male teacher, merchant, accountant,
clerk, cook, tailor, hatter, footman, etc.;</p>

<p>I grant that it is embarrassing to your triumphant
argument to encounter the thousands of <i>facts</i> which
show us the <i>real</i> woman performing numerous functions
in competition with you;</p>

<p>So it is, and these facts must be taken into account.
But gentlemen, I have you in a dilemma! if functions
are the basis of right, as right is equal, functions are
equivalent; in which case those performed by woman are
not inferior, since none are so. The functions which
she performs are therefore equivalent to yours, and, by
this equivalence, she again becomes equal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"> 215</a></span>
Or else functions are not the basis of right; did you
not take them into account when the establishment of
your right was in question; why then do you speak of
functions when the question is the right of woman?</p>

<p>Extricate yourself from this as you can; I shall not
help you.</p>

<p class="subh">II.</p>

<p>3. Woman produces less than man industrially, you
say. Admitting this to be true, do you count as nothing
the great maternal function&mdash;the risks that woman
runs in accomplishing it;</p>

<p>Do you count as nothing the labors of the household,
the cares that are lavished upon you, and to which you
owe cleanliness and health?</p>

<p>If the quantity of the product be the origin of the
equality of right, why have those who produce little,
those who produce nothing, and all of you who produce
unequally, equal right?</p>

<p>Why are all those women who produce, while their
husbands and sons enjoy and dissipate, destitute of the
rights which the latter possess?</p>

<p>You do not admit the question of product into that
of right when man is in question, why then do you admit
it when woman is in question?</p>

<p>You see that this is inconsiderate, irrational, unjust.</p>

<p>4. Woman cannot be the equal of man, because her
peculiar temperament interdicts to her certain functions.</p>

<p>Well, then a legislator can, without being unreasonable,
decree that all men who are unfitted by temperament
for the profession of arms, for instance, are excluded
from equality of right!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"> 216</a></span>
Temperament, the source of right?</p>

<p>If a woman had written anything so absurd, she
would have been cried down from one end of the world
to the other.</p>

<p>Why, gentlemen, do you not exclude from equality
all men who are weak, all those who are incapable of
performing the functions that you <i>prejudge</i> woman incapable
of performing?</p>

<p>When you are in question, you admit indeed that the
right to perform every function supposes neither the
faculty nor the inclination to make use of it; why do you
not reason in the same manner when the question concerns
us? What would you think of women if, having
your rights while you were in subjection, they should
keep you in an inferior position because you could not
accomplish the great functions of gestation and lactation.</p>

<p>Man, they would say, being unable to be mother and
nurse, shall not have the right of being instructed like
us; of having, like us, civil dignity. His coarser temperament
renders him incapable of being a witness to a
certificate of birth or death; it is evident that his clumsiness
excludes him judicially from diplomatic functions;
we cannot therefore recognize his right to solicit them,
etc.</p>

<p>Ah! gentlemen, you reason in the same manner in
excluding woman from equality under the pretext that,
in general, she is of a temperament weaker than your
own; that is, you reason absurdly.</p>

<p>5. Woman cannot be the equal of man in right because
he protects and maintains her.</p>

<p>If it is because you protect and maintain us, that we
ought not to have our right, restore it then to unmarried
women who are of age, and to widows whom you
neither protect nor maintain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"> 217</a></span>
Restore their right then to the wives who have no
need of your protection, since the law protects them,
even against you; to the wives whom you do not maintain,
since they bring you either a dowry, or a profession,
or services which you would be obliged to recompense
if any other rendered them to you.</p>

<p>And if to be maintained by another, suffices to deprive
an individual of his right, take it away from the
host of men who are maintained by the incomes or the
labor of their wives.</p>

<p>6. Man, in the exercise of certain rights, is the
proxy of woman.</p>

<p>Gentleman, a proxy is chosen freely, and is not imposed
on an individual; I do not accept you as proxies: I
am intelligent enough to transact my business myself,
and I pray you to restore to me, as well as to all the
women who think as I do, an authority which you use
unworthily. If married women, to have peace, are
willing to continue you as their authority, it is their
business; but none of you can legitimately retain that
of widows and unmarried women who have attained
majority.</p>

<p>7. Woman has not the same rights as man, because
she has no more time than capacity to exercise them.</p>

<p>Has woman less time and capacity than your working
men, pinned twelve hours a day to their petty and stultifying
tasks? Affirm it if you dare!</p>

<p>Does it need less time and capacity to make a deposition
in a criminal suit, as woman does, than to witness
a civil act or a notarial contract, a right that woman has
not.</p>

<p>Does it need less time and capacity to be the guardian
of sons and to administer their fortune, as woman does,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"> 218</a></span>
than to be the guardian of a stranger or of a nephew,
and administer their property, a right that woman has
not.</p>

<p>Does it need less time and capacity to superintend a
manufactory, a commercial establishment, workmen, as
do so many women, than to be at the head of an office,
or of a public administration, and to superintend its
officials, a right that woman has not?</p>

<p>Does it need less time and capacity to devote one's
self to instruction in a large boarding school, as do so
many women, than in the chair of a professorship, as
man alone has the right to do?</p>

<p>Woman proves, <i>by her works</i>, that she lacks capacity
and time no more than you. Facts stifle affirmations for
which you should blush. Fie! I am glad that I am not
a man, lest I might say like things and be led to pretend
that an instructress, a literary woman, a woman artist,
an experienced female merchant has not the capacity of
a porter or a rag-picker because she has not a beard on
her chin.</p>

<p>8. The rights of woman are in her beauty and in
the love of man.</p>

<p>Rights, based on beauty, and on that fragile thing
styled man's love! What are these worth, I ask you,
gentlemen?</p>

<p>Then woman shall have rights if she is beautiful, and
as long as she shall continue so; if she is beloved, and
as long as she shall continue so? Old, ugly and forsaken,
she must be thrown into the car of the condemned to be
transported to the guillotine?</p>

<p>If a woman should say such things, what a universal
hue and cry would be raised?</p>

<p>Yet men pretend that they are rational! We congratulate
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"> 219</a></span>
woman on having too much common sense ever to
be so in this wise.</p>

<p>After all these arguments, none of which will bear
analysis, comes at last the triumphant objection: women
do not claim their rights, many among them are even
scandalized by the demand made by a few in the name
of all. Do not women demand them, gentlemen?</p>

<p>What are a host of American women doing at the
present time?</p>

<p>What have a number of English women done already?</p>

<p>What did Jean Deroin, Pauline Roland and many
others, do here in 1848?</p>

<p>What am I doing to-day, in the name of a legion of
women of whom I am the interpreter?</p>

<p><i>All</i> women do not make reclamations, no; but do
you not know that every demand of right is made at
first singly?</p>

<p>That slaves accustomed to their chains, do not feel
them until their instigators to revolt show them the
bruises on their flesh?</p>

<p>A few only demand their rights, you say; but is it
in accordance with principle or with numbers that you
judge of the justice of a cause?</p>

<p>Did you wait until <i>all</i> the male population demanded
their right of universal suffrage in order to decree it to
them?</p>

<p>Did you wait for the revendication of <i>all</i> the slaves of
your colonies before emancipating them?</p>

<p>Yes, it is true, gentlemen, that many women are
opposed to the emancipation of their sex. What does
this prove? That there are human beings abased
enough to have lost all sentiment of dignity; but not
that right is not right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"> 220</a></span>
Among the blacks, there are many who hate, denounce,
and deliver up to the scourge and to death
those among them who are meditating how to break
their chains; which is right, which has the sentiment
of human dignity, the latter or the former?</p>

<p>We demand our place at your side, gentlemen, because
identity of species gives us the right to occupy it.</p>

<p>We demand our right, because the inferiority inwhich
we are kept is one of the most active causes of
the decay of morals.</p>

<p>We demand our right, because we are persuaded
that woman has to set her stamp on Science, Philosophy,
Justice and Politics.</p>

<p>We demand our right, lastly, because we are convinced
that the general questions, the lack of solution
of which threatens our modern civilization with ruin,
can only be resolved by the co-operation of woman delivered
from her fetters and left free in her genius.</p>

<p>Is it not a great proof of our insanity, our <i>impurity</i>,
gentlemen, that we feel this ardent desire to check the
corruption of morals, and to labor for the triumph of
Justice, the coming of the reign of Duty and Reason,
the establishment of an order of things in which humanity,
worthier and happier, shall pursue its glorious destinies
without the accompaniment of cannon or the
shedding of blood?</p>

<p>Is it not because the advocates of emancipation are
<i>impure women whom sin has rendered mad, beings incapable
of comprehending Justice and conscientious
works</i>?</p>

<p class="subh">III.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, we will conclude.</p>

<p>Though that were true which I deny; that woman
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"> 221</a></span>
is inferior to you; though that were true which <i>facts</i>
prove false; that she can perform none of the functions
which you perform, that she is fit only for maternity
and the household, she would be none the less your
equal in right, because right is based neither on superiority
of faculties nor on that of the functions which
proceed from them, but on identity of species.</p>

<p>A human being, like you, having, like you, intellect,
will, free will and various aptitudes, woman has the
right, like you, to be free and autonomous, to develop
her faculties freely, to exercise her activity freely; to
mark out her path, to reduce her to subjection, as you
do, is therefore a violation of Human Right in the person
of woman&mdash;an odious abuse of force.</p>

<p>From the stand point of facts, this violation of right
takes the form of grievous inconsistency; for we find
many women far superior to the majority of men; whence
it follows that right is granted to those who ought not
to have it, according to your doctrine, and refused to
those who ought to possess it, according to the same
doctrine, since they make good their claim to the qualities
requisite.</p>

<p>We find that you accord right to qualities and functions,
<i>because the individual is a man</i>, and that you
cease to recognize it in the same case, <i>because the individual
is a woman</i>.</p>

<p>Yet you boast of your lofty reason,&mdash;yet you boast of
possessing the sense of justice!</p>

<p>Take care, gentlemen! Our rights have the same
foundation as yours: in denying the former, you deny
the latter in principle.</p>

<p>A word more to you, pretended disciples of the doctrines
of '89, and we have done. Do you know why
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"> 222</a></span>
so many women took part with our Revolution, armed
the men, and rocked their children to the song of the
<i>Marseillaise</i>! It was because they thought they saw
under the Declaration of the rights of men and citizens,
the declaration of the rights of women and female citizens.</p>

<p>When the Assembly took it upon itself to undeceive
them, by lacking logic with respect to them, and closing
their meetings, they abandoned the Revolution, and
you know what ensued.</p>

<p>Do you know why, in 1848, so many women, especially
among the people, declared themselves for the Revolution?
It was because they hoped that this Revolution
would be more consistent with respect to them
than the former had been.</p>

<p>When, in their senseless arrogance and lack of intelligence,
the representatives not only forbid them to
assemble, but <i>drove</i> them from the assemblies of men,
the women abandoned the Revolution by detaching
their husbands and sons from it, and you know what
ensued.</p>

<p>Do you comprehend at last?</p>

<p>I tell you truly; all your struggles are in vain, if
woman does not go with you.</p>

<p>An order of things may be established by a <i>coup de
main</i>, but it is only maintained by the adhesion of majorities;
and these majorities, gentlemen, are formed by
us women, through the influence that we possess over
men, through the education that we give them with our
milk.</p>

<p>We have it in our power to inspire them from their
cradles with love, hatred or indifference for certain principles;
in this is our strength; and you are blind not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"> 223</a></span>
to comprehend that if man is on one side and woman
on the other, humanity is condemned to weave Penelope's
web.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, woman is ripe for civil liberty, and we
declare to you that we shall henceforth regard whoever
shall rise against our lawful claim as an enemy of progress
and of the Revolution; while we shall rank among
the friends of progress and of the Revolution, those
who declare themselves in favor of our civil emancipation,
<span class="smallc">SHOULD THEY BE YOUR ADVERSARIES</span>?</p>

<p>If you refuse to listen to our lawful demands, we
shall accuse you before posterity of the crime with
which you reproach the holders of slaves.</p>

<p>We shall accuse you before posterity of having denied
the faculties of woman, because you feared her
competition.</p>

<p>We shall accuse you before posterity of having refused
her justice, because you wished to make her your servant
and plaything. We shall accuse you before posterity
of being enemies of right and progress.</p>

<p>And our accusation will remain standing and living
before future generations who, more enlightened, more
just, more moral than you, will turn away their eyes
with disdain and contempt from the tomb of their
fathers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"> 224</a></span></p>
<p class="titre">NATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF WOMAN<br />
<span class="medium">I.</span></p>

<p>I think that we have sufficiently though summarily
proved to all honest inquiries that social right is identical
for both sexes since they are identical in species.
The question of right being placed beyond discussion,
we can now ask what use woman shall make of
her right; in other terms, what functions she is qualified
to perform in accordance with her whole nature.</p>

<p>Let us first mark the profound difference that exists
between right and function, then define and divide the
latter.</p>

<p><i>Right</i> is the condition <i>sine qua non</i> of the development
and manifestations of the human being: it is absolute,
general for the whole species, because the individuals
who compose it should be able lawfully to develop
and manifest themselves.</p>

<p><i>Function</i> is the use of the faculties of the individual
with a view to a purpose useful to himself and to others;
function is therefore a production of utility and, in conclusion,
the manifestation of the aptitudes predominating
in each of us, whether naturally, or in consequence
of education and habit.</p>

<p>Society, having needs of every kind, has functions of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"> 225</a></span>
every nature and various scope; these functions may
be classified as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li> 1. &nbsp; Scientific and philosophic functions;</li>
<li> 2. &nbsp; Industrial functions;</li>
<li> 3. &nbsp; Artistic functions;</li>
<li> 4. &nbsp; Educational functions;</li>
<li> 5. &nbsp; Medical functions;</li>
<li> 6. &nbsp; Functions for the preservation of safety;</li>
<li> 7. &nbsp; Judicial functions;</li>
<li> 8. &nbsp; Functions of exchange and circulation;</li>
<li> 9. &nbsp; Administrative and governmental functions;</li>
<li> 10. Legislative functions;</li>
<li> 11. Functions of solidarity or of social benevolence and of institutions for the prevention of crime.</li>
</ul>

<p>This classification, which would be very imperfect and
insufficient, were this a treatise on social organization,
being all that is needed for the use that we have to
make of it, we shall adhere to it in this place.</p>

<p>Men, and women after them, have deemed proper
hitherto to class man and woman separately; to define
each type, and to deduce from this ideal the functions
suited to each sex. Neither have chosen to see that
numerous facts contradict their classification.</p>

<p>What! exclaims the classifiers, do you deny that the
sexes differ? Do you deny that, if they differ, they
should have different functions?</p>

<p>If our classification does not seem good to you, criticise
it, we ask nothing more; but replace it by a better
one.</p>

<p>To criticise your classification, ladies and gentlemen,
is what I intend to do; but if the elements are wanting
to establish a better, can you, ought you even to require
me to present you one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"> 226</a></span>
Do you think me a man, that you exact of me abuse
of the <i>à priora</i>, and a startling arbitrary course of reasoning.
"Proudhon is right," murmur these gentlemen;
"woman is incapable of abstract reasoning, of generalizing,
of <i>knowing herself</i>"....</p>

<p>Really, gentlemen, do you think that it is through incapacity
that I am unwilling to present to you a classification
of the sexes, a theory of the nature of woman?...
Let us hasten then to prove the contrary: instead of
one theory, we will give you <i>four</i>. Man and woman
form a series only with respect to the reproduction of
the species: all the other characteristics by which it has
been attempted to make a distinction between them are
only generalities contradicted by a multitude of facts;
now, as a generality is not a law, nothing can be therefore
concluded from these, nothing absolute deduced from
them in a functional point of view.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the greatest radical difference of
zoological species lies in the nervous system, especially
in the greater or lesser bulk and complexity of the encephalus;
now, Anatomy admits, after numerous experiments,
that, in proportion to the whole size of the
body, the brain of woman equals in volume that of man;
that the composition of both is the same, and Phrenology
adds that the organs of the brain are the same in
both sexes.</p>

<p>Lastly, it is a biological principle that organs are developed
by exercise and atrophied by continued repose;
now, man and woman do not exercise their encephalic
organs in the same manner; educational training, manners,
prejudice, enforced habits tend to develop in the
masculine what becomes atrophied in the feminine head;
whence it follows that the differences empirically established
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"> 227</a></span>
are by no means the result of Nature, but of the
accidental causes by which they have been produced.</p>

<p>Conclusion: the two sexes therefore, when reared
alike become developed alike, and are fit for the same
functions, except those which concern the reproduction
of the species.</p>

<p>Here, gentlemen, is a theory complete in all its parts,
tenable in an anatomo-biologic point of view, and
which I challenge you to prove false, for I shall find replies
to all your objections.</p>

<p class="subh">II.</p>

<p>We admit the principle that the sexes form series in
physical, moral, intellectual, consequently functional
respects.</p>

<p>We believe that they should become subordinate to
each other in proportion to their relative excellence;
and we take the destiny of the species as the touchstone
of their respective value.</p>

<p>If we compare the sexes with each other, we prove
in a general way, that man is merely woman on a
coarser scale; we prove in the second place that he is
far more animal than woman, since his muscular system
is more fully developed and since he respires lower; so
that he is most evidently a medium between woman and
the higher species of apes.</p>

<p>Woman alone contains and develops the human
germ; she is the creator and preserver of the race.</p>

<p>It is not quite certain that the co-operation of man is
necessary for the work of reproduction; <i>this is the
means chosen by Nature</i>, but human science will succeed,
we hope, in delivering woman from this insupportable
subjection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"> 228</a></span>
Analogy authorises us to believe that woman, the sole
depositary of the human germ, is equally the sole depositary
of all the moral and intellectual germs, whence
it follows that she is the inspirer of all knowledge,
all discoveries, all justice, the mother of all virtue.
Our analogous deductions are confirmed by facts; woman
employs her intellect in the concrete; she is an
acute observer; man is only fit to construct paradoxes
and to lose himself in the abyss of metaphysics; science
has only emerged from the limbo of <i>à priora</i> without
confirmation, since the advent into this domain of the
form of the feminine mind; we shall affirm, therefore,
that true scholars are feminized minds.</p>

<p>In moral respects, man and woman differ greatly; the
former is harsh, rough, without delicacy, devoid of sensibility
and modesty; his habitual relations with the
other sex modify him only with great difficulty; woman
is naturally gentle, loving, feeling, equitable, modest;
to her, man owes justice and his other virtues,
when he has any; whence it follows that it is really to
woman alone that social progress is due; hence it is
that every step made towards civilization is marked by
an advance of woman towards liberty.</p>

<p>If we consider each of the sexes in their relation to
human destiny, we are forced to admit that, if there
was reason for the predominance of man in the necessity
of hewing out this destiny, the pre-eminence of woman
is ensured in the future reign of right and peace.</p>

<p>It was necessary to struggle and fight in order to establish
justice and to subject nature to humanity; this
belonged of right to man, who represents muscular
force, the spirit of conflict; but as we already foresee
in the approaching future, the coming of peace, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"> 229</a></span>
substitution of pacific labor and negotiations for war, it
is clear that woman will take rightfully the direction of
human affairs, to which she will be called by her faculties,
found better adapted to the end henceforth to be
pursued.</p>

<p>Woman should be the last to develop and manifest
herself socially, for the same reason that the human
species is the last creation of our globe; the perfect being
always appears after those that have served to pave
the way.</p>

<p>As it is demonstrated, on the other hand, that, in the
scale of the various organisms, the organ that is superadded
to the others to constitute a change of species,
governs those which the individual derives from inferior
species, so woman, fully developed in a social body organized
for peace and pacific labor, will be the new organ
that will govern the social body.</p>

<p>Does this signify that woman should oppress man?
By no means; she would thus be ungrateful for the services
rendered her, and would trespass against her gentle
nature; but she will teach him to comprehend that
<i>his glory is to obey</i>, to become subordinate to the other
sex, because he is less perfect, and because his qualities
are no longer necessary to the general good.</p>

<p>You laugh, gentlemen, at this second theory; you
think it absurd.... So it is; for it is the counterpart
of the thetic woman of Proudhon. Let us proceed
then to the third theory.</p>

<p class="subh">III.</p>

<p>Every classification of the human species is a pure
subjective creation; that is, one which exists only in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"> 230</a></span>
the form given to the perception by the intellect; the
very conception of humanity with the enumeration of
the characteristics which are reputed to distinguish it
from the other species, is stamped with subjectivity.</p>

<p>The truth is that not a single human being resembles
his neighbor; that there are as many different men and
women as there are men and women composing the
species.</p>

<p>Classifications, in all things, are illusions of the mind,
for nature hates identity and never repeats herself: there
are not two grains of sand, not two drops of water, not
two leaves alike; and most probably the sun, since the
commencement of its existence, has not appeared twice
identically the same at its rising. Yet despite the evidence
of these truths, despite the conviction which we
have attained of the illusion of the senses, of the weakness
of our intellect, which can know nothing of the
inmost nature of beings; which can only seize upon a
few fleeting traces of their personal characteristics;
yet despite all these things we dare establish series, attribute
to them characteristics which are speedily contradicted
by facts, and torture and do violence to the only
beings that really exist; namely, individuals, in the name
of that other thing which exists only in our sick brain:
kind, class!</p>

<p>The bitter fruits that have been produced by our
mania for classification ought to cure us of this. Has
not this malady, impelling theocratists and legislators to
divide humanity into castes and classes, caused most
of the calamities of our species? Have we not, thanks
to these execrable divisions, a hideous past, the echoes
of which bring back to our shrinking ears naught
but sobs, cries of anger, rebellion, malediction and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"> 231</a></span>
vengeance, and sinister clanking of weapons and
chains?</p>

<p>Have we not also to thank them that, on the pages
of our history, all stained with blood and tears and exhaling
an odor of the charnel house, we read nought but
tyranny, brutishness and demoralization?</p>

<p>Have we not further to thank them that king and
subject, master and serf, white and black, man and woman
become demoralized by oppression, injustice and
cruelty on one hand; and intrigue, baseness, and vengeance
on the other?</p>

<p>Are not wrong and wretchedness found everywhere,
because inequality, the offspring of insane classifications,
is found everywhere?</p>

<p>Ah! who shall deliver us from our infatuation!</p>

<p>Let us class animals, vegetables, minerals if we will!
our errors do not influence and cannot disturb them;
but let us respect the human species which will escape
all classification, however reasonable the process may be,
because every human being is changeable, progressive,
and differs far more from his fellows than the most intelligent
animal from the rest of his species.</p>

<p>Let us leave each one then to make his own autonomic
law and to manifest himself in conformity with
his nature, and take care only that right shall be equal
for all; that the strong shall not oppress the weak;
that each function shall be entrusted to the one individual
that is proved the best qualified to perform it; this
is all that we can do, all that we should do, if we seek
to show ourselves wise and just.</p>

<p>Harmony exists in nature, because each being in it
follows peaceably the laws that govern his individuality;
it will be the same in humanity, when universal reason
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"> 232</a></span>
shall comprehend that human order is pre-established in
the co-operation of individual faculties left free in their
manifestations; and that to establish a factitious, wholly
imaginary order; that is, true disorder, is to retard the
coming of order, peace and happiness.</p>

<p>Let us refrain then from all classification of faculties
and functions according to the sexes: besides being false,
they will lead us to cruelty; for we shall oppress those,
whether men or women, who are neither yielding
enough to submit to it nor hypocritical enough to appear
to do so; and we shall do this without profit to human
destiny, but, on the contrary, to its detriment.</p>

<p>Here, gentlemen, is a <i>nominalistic</i> theory which I
challenge you to overthrow by sufficient reasons: for,
as in the first, I shall have answers to all your objections.</p>

<p>We now come to our last theory, which is yours in
the major and minor terms, but the opposite in the conclusions.</p>

<p class="subh">IV.</p>

<p>All the different parts of the same organism are modified
by each other, and in this manner the functions
become mutually modified.</p>

<p>Now, man and woman differ from each other in important
organs.</p>

<p>Each of the sexes must therefore differ from the other
not only through the organs that distinguish them, but
through the modifications produced by the presence of
these organs.</p>

<p>This, gentleman, is my first syllogism: I know that
we shall not contest this point&mdash;it is classical Biology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"> 233</a></span>
Let us investigate anatomically the organic differences
to which sexuality subjects man and woman.</p>

<p><i>Nervous System.</i> The so called nerves of feeling
are more fully developed in woman than in man, those
of motion are less developed in the former than in the
latter; the cerebellum is more fully developed in the
head of man than in that of woman; in the latter, the
antero-posterior diameter of the brain preponderates
over the bi-lateral, which is greater in proportion in the
masculine sex: it is also observed that the organs of
observation, circumspection, subtleness and philoprogenitiveness
are more prominent in the head of woman than
in that of man, in which the reasoning organs, with
those of combativeness and destructiveness predominate.</p>

<p><i>Locomotive System.</i> Man is larger than woman, he
has more compact bones, and larger and better developed
muscles, his thorax is the reverse of that of woman,
in which, the greatest breadth is between the
shoulders, while, with him, it is at the base; the pelvis
is larger and broader in the female than the male sex.</p>

<p><i>Epidermic and cellular systems.</i> Man has a more
hairy skin than woman; what is called fat is less abundant
in the masculine than in the feminine organism;
in general, the skin of man is rougher, and his form less
round; woman has longer and more silky hair. <i>Splanchnic
organs.</i> The cerebral mass is the same in proportion
in both sexes, as well as the organs of the brain,
with the exception of the predominances which we have
pointed out; the respiratory systems differ somewhat;
woman breaths higher than man; in the latter, the circulation
is more active and energetic.</p>

<p>To these physical differences correspond intellectual
and moral differences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"> 234</a></span>
Woman, having the nerves of feeling more fully developed,
is more impressionable and more mobile than
man.</p>

<p>Being weaker and as persistent, she obtains by address
and stratagem what she cannot obtain by force;
her weakness gives her timidity, circumspection, the
necessity of feeling herself protected.</p>

<p>The kinds of labor that require strength are repugnant
to her.</p>

<p>Her maternal destiny renders her an enemy of destruction,
of war; and her more delicate organization
makes her dread and shun contention. This same maternal
destination impresses a peculiar stamp on her intellect;
she loves the concrete, and is always inclined
to transform thought into facts, to incarnate it, to give
it a fixed form; her reasoning is intuition or quick perception
of a general relation, of a truth that man elucidates
only with great difficulty, by the aid of stilted
logic.</p>

<p>Woman is a better observer than man, and carries
induction farther than he; she is consequently more
penetrating, and is a much better judge of the moral and
intellectual value of those about her.</p>

<p>She has, more than man, sentiment of the beautiful,
delicacy of heart, love of good, respect for modesty,
veneration for everything superior.</p>

<p>More provident than he, she has more order and economy,
and looks after administrative details with a
carefulness which is often carried to puerility.</p>

<p>Woman is adroit, sedulous; she excels in works of
taste, and possesses strong artistic tendencies.</p>

<p>Gentler, more tender, more patient than man, she
loves everything that is weak, protects everything that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"> 235</a></span>
suffers; every sorrow, every calamity brings a tear to
her eye and draws a sigh from her breast.</p>

<p>This is woman, such as you paint her, gentlemen.</p>

<p>You then add:</p>

<p>The vocation of woman therefore is love, maternity,
the household, sedentary occupations.</p>

<p>She is too weak for occupations that demand strength,
and for those of war.</p>

<p>She is too impressionable and too feeling, too good,
too gentle to be legislator, judge or juror.</p>

<p>Her taste for household details, a retired life, and the
grave functions of maternity indicate clearly that she
is not made for public employments. She is too variable
to cultivate science with profit; too feeble and too
much occupied beside to pursue protracted experiments.</p>

<p>Her kind of rationality renders her unsuited to the
elaboration of theories; and she is too fond of the concrete
and of details to become seriously interested in
general ideas; which excludes her from all high professional
functions and from those requiring serious
study.</p>

<p>Her place is therefore at the fireside to make man
better, to sustain him, to care for him, to procure him
the joys of paternity, and to fill the place of a good
housewife.</p>

<p>Such are your conclusions: here are mine, admitting
as a hypothesis, what I affirm with you of woman.</p>

<p class="subh">V.</p>

<p>1. Woman carrying into Philosophy and Science her
subtleness of observation, her love of the concrete, will
correct the exaggerated tendency of man for abstract
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"> 236</a></span>
reasoning, and demonstrate the falsity of theories constructed,
<i>à priori</i>, on a few facts alone. Then only will
ontology disappear, then will it be recognized that a hypothesis
is merely an interrogation point; that truth is
always intelligible in its nature, however unknown it
may be; we shall generalize nothing but known facts,
we shall carefully avoid erecting simple generalities into
laws, and we shall thus have veritable philosophy, and
true human science, because they will bear the imprint
of both sexes.</p>

<p>2. Woman carrying her peculiar faculties into the
arts and manufactures, will increasingly introduce therein
art, perfection in details. Cultivated in the direction
of her aptitudes, she will find ingenious methods of application
of scientific discoveries.</p>

<p>3. Patient, gentle, good, more moral than man, she
is the born educator of childhood, the moralizer of the
grown man; the majority of the educational functions
revert to her of right, and she has her assigned place in
special instruction.</p>

<p>4. By her quick intuition and her acuteness of observation,
woman alone can discover the therapeutics of
nervous affections; her dexterity will render her valuable
in all delicate surgical operations. On her should
devolve the care of treating the diseases of women and
children, because she alone is capable of fully comprehending
them; she has her especial place in hospitals,
not only for the cure of disease, but also for the execution
and surveillance of the details of management and
the care of the patients.</p>

<p>5. The presence of woman in judicial functions, as
juror and arbiter, will be a guarantee of veritable human
justice to all; that is, of equity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"> 237</a></span>
Woman alone through her gentleness, her mercy, her
sympathetic disposition, and her subtleness and observation,
can comprehend that society has its share of
culpability in every fault committed; for it should be
organized to prevent wrong rather than to punish it.
This point of view, especially feminine, will transform
the penitentiary system and raise up numerous institutions.
Then only will the world comprehend that the
punishment inflicted on the guilty should be a means of
reparation and regeneration; society will no longer slay
its prisoners as if weak and fearful: it will amend the
assassin instead of imitating him; it will force the thief
to work to make restitution of what he has stolen; it
will no longer believe that it has the right by imprisoning
a criminal to deprive him of his reason, to drive him
to despair, to suicide by solitary confinement; to deprive
him completely of marriage; to couple him with
those more corrupt than himself. Conscious of its own
share of culpability, society will repair in penitentiaries
the fault of its carelessness: it will be firm, yet kind
and moralizing: it will give in them the education
which it ought to have given outside, and will prepare
work houses for the liberated convicts in order that the
contempt and horror often shown toward them by men
worse than they may not drive them to a second offence.</p>

<p>7. Woman, carrying into the social household her
spirit of order and economy, her love of details and abhorrence
of waste and foolish expense, will reform government:
she will simplify everything; will suppress
sinecures and the accumulation of offices, and will produce
much from little instead of, like man, producing
little from much: the purse of the tax-payers will not
complain of the change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"> 238</a></span>
8. Under the direct influence of woman as legislator,
we shall have a reconstruction of all laws; first and
before everything, we shall have preventive measures,
a compulsory education; then the form of legal proceedings
will be simplified, the civil code recast, and all
laws concerning illegitimate children and the inequality
of the sexes banished from it; the laws concerning morals
will be more severe, and the penal code more rational
and equitable.</p>

<p>By her administrative reforms born of the economical
instinct of woman, taxes will be diminished; her
abhorrence of blood and war will greatly reduce the
fearful impost of blood-shed. Having a deliberative
voice, and knowing, by her griefs and love the value of
a man, it will be only from sheer necessity that she will
consent to vote bevies of citizens for the shambles called
wars: she will do this only when her country is menaced
or when it is necessary to protect oppressed nationalities;
in all other cases, she will employ the system of
conciliation.</p>

<p>9. Woman, being much more economical and a better
analyst than man, when thoroughly instructed, will
soon perceive that nations, like individuals, differ in
aptitudes, and that the end of these differences is union
and fraternity through exchange of products: she will
therefore deter her country from cultivating certain
branches of the acts and manufactures in which other
nations excel and which they can produce to better advantage;
she will cure it of the foolish pretension of
being sufficient unto itself, and will prevent it from sacrificing
the interest of the mass of consumers to that of a
few producers: thus the barriers and custom duties that
separate the different organs of humanity will fall by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"> 239</a></span>
degrees; there will be treaties of free trade, and all
will be gainers by the cheapness of products, and the
suppression of the expenses of maintaining a too often
annoying department of customs.</p>

<p>The qualities and faculties of woman not only make
her an educator, but assure her preponderance in all
functions arising from social solidarity; she alone knows
how to console, to encourage, to moralize with gentleness,
to comfort with delicacy; she has the genius of charity;
to her therefore should revert the superintendence and
direction of hospitals and prisons for women, the management
of charitable institutions, the care of abandoned
children, etc. She should create institutions to furnish
employment to workmen out of work, and to save liberated
convicts from indolence and relapse into crime.</p>

<p>Thus, gentleman, without departing from the data of
your theory, you behold woman placed everywhere by
the side of man, except in the hard labor from which
you yourselves will soon be released by machinery, and
in the military institutions which, in all probability, will
some day disappear.</p>

<p>Hitherto institutions, laws, sciences, philosophy have
chiefly borne the masculine imprint; all of these things
are only half human; in order that they may become
wholly so, woman must be associated in them ostensibly
and lawfully, consequently, she must be cultivated
like you; culture will not make her like you, do not
fear it; the rose and the carnation growing in the
same soil, under the same sky, in the same sunshine,
with the cares of the same gardener, remain rose and
carnation: they are more beautiful in proportion as
they are better cultivated, and as the elements which
they absorb are more abundant: if man and woman
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"> 240</a></span>
differ, a similar education will only make them differ
still more, because each will employ it in the development
of that which is peculiar to himself.</p>

<p>For the interest of all things and people it is necessary
that woman should enter all the avocations of life,
that she should have her function in all the functions:
<i>after</i> the general interest of humanity, comes that of
the family; it cannot go <i>before</i> it.</p>

<p>Since woman now is generally mother and housewife
while performing at the same time a host of other functions,
she will become none the less so in taking upon
herself a few more; besides, the time of life at which
an individual enters certain important functions is that
at which woman has finished her maternal task. A few
women acting as public functionaries will not hinder the
great majority of their companions from remaining in
private life, any more than a few men in the same position
hinder the mass of men from continuing there.</p>

<p class="subh">VI.</p>

<p>You admit a classification at last, you say, and still
more you grant that there are masculine and feminine
functions. You are mistaken, gentlemen: you accused
me of being incapable of giving you a complete theory,
I have given you the outlines of four&mdash;outlines which
it would be easy for me to extend and perfect. But I
do not admit a single one of these theories as a whole.</p>

<p>Are you eclectic, then?</p>

<p>The gods forbid! I have as much repugnance to
eclecticism, as to <i>mystic trinitarianism</i> and <i>androgyny</i>.</p>

<p>I do not admit the theory of the identity of the sexes,
because I believe with Biology that an essential organic
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"> 241</a></span>
difference modifies the entire being; that therefore
woman must differ from man.</p>

<p>I do not admit the theory of the superiority of either
sex, because it is absurd; humanity is man-woman
or woman-man; we do not know what one sex would
be if it were not incessantly modified by its relations
with the other, and we know them only as thus
modified: What we know to a certainty is that they
form together the existing condition of humanity; that
they are equally necessary and equally useful to each
other and to society.</p>

<p>I do not admit my third theory because it is ultra-nominalism
nominalism; if it is really true that all the individuals of
both sexes differ among themselves in a far more remarkable
manner than those of the other species, it is none
the less true that a classification, founded upon a constant
anatomical characteristic, is legitimate, and that the
principle of classification lies in the nature of things,
for if things appear to us classified, it is because they
are so; the laws of the mind are the same as those of
Nature so far as knowledge is concerned; we must
admit this, unless we are sceptics or idealists, and I am
neither the one nor the other; neither am I a realist in
the philosophic acceptation of the word, for I do not believe
that the species is something apart from the individuals
in which it is manifested; it is in them and
through them; this repeats the affirmation that there
are individuals identical in one or several respects, although
different in all others.</p>

<p>Lastly, I do not admit the fourth theory, although it
may be true in principle, because the numerous facts
that contradict the distinguishing characteristics, do not
permit me to believe that these characteristics are laws
established by sexuality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"> 242</a></span>
In fact, there are brains of men in heads of women,
and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>Men mobile and impressionable; women firm and
insensible.</p>

<p>Women large, strong and muscular, lifting a man like
a feather; men small, frail, and of extreme delicacy of
constitution.</p>

<p>Women with a stentorian voice and abrupt manners;
men with a soft voice and graceful manners.</p>

<p>Women with short, harsh hair, bearded, with rough
skin and angular figures; men with long, silky hair
without beard, round and portly.</p>

<p>Women with an energetic circulation of blood; men
in whose veins it courses feebly and slowly.</p>

<p>Women frank, inconsiderate and daring; men strategic,
dissembling and timid.</p>

<p>Women violent, loving strife, war and contention, and
wont to storm on every occasion; men gentle, patient,
dreading strife, and exceedingly timid.</p>

<p>Women loving abstract reasoning, generalizing and
synthetizing much, and without intuition of any sort;
men intuitive, acute observers, good analysts, incapable
of generalizing.... I know many such.</p>

<p>Women insensible to works of art, and without the
sentiment of the beautiful; men full of enthusiasm for
both.</p>

<p>Women immoral, immodest, respecting nothing or
no one; men moral, chaste and reverential.</p>

<p>Women extravagant and disorderly; men economical
and parsimonious to avarice.</p>

<p>Women thoroughly selfish, rigid, disposed to take advantage
of the weakness, kindness, folly or misery of
others; men full of generosity, mansuetude, and self-sacrifice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"> 243</a></span>
What follows from these undeniable facts? that the
law of sexual differences is not manifested through the
several characteristics which have been laid down.</p>

<p>That these characteristics may be only the result of
education, of the difference of prejudices, of that of
occupations, etc.</p>

<p>That, as these generalities may be the fruit of the difference
of training and surroundings, nothing can be legitimately
deduced from them as to the functions of woman;
would it not be absurd, in fact, to pretend that a woman
who is organized for philosophy and the sciences <i>can not</i>,
ought not to occupy herself with them because she is a
woman, while a man, who is incapable of them but
foolish and vain enough to be ignorant of his incapacity,
can and ought to engage in them because he is a man?</p>

<p>Functions belong to those who prove their aptitude
for them, and not to an abstraction called sex, for, definitively,
every function is individual in its aggregate or
in its elements.</p>

<p class="subh">VII.</p>

<p>We have explained why we reject the theories that
we have sketched; we will now explain why we neither
give nor wish to give a classification of the sexes.</p>

<p>We do not give a classification, because we neither
have nor can have one; the elements for its establishment
are lacking. A biological deduction permits us to
affirm that such a one exists; but it is impossible to
disengage its law in the present surroundings; the veritable
feminine stamp will be known only after one or two
centuries of like education and equal rights: then there
will be no need of a classification, for the function will
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"> 244</a></span>
fall naturally to the proper functionary under a system
of equality in which the social elements classify themselves.</p>

<p>My belief and my hopes concerning the future, I
shall not confess; for I may be in error, since I have no
facts to control my intuitions, and everything that is
purely Utopian has always a dangerous side. Besides
have I not said that, had I formed a classification, I
should not give it? Why not? Because, a detestable
use would be made of it, as usual, if it were adopted.</p>

<p>Hitherto, have not men availed themselves of classifications
based upon characteristics afterwards recognized
as purely imaginary to oppress, distort and calumniate
those banished to the inferior ranks?</p>

<p>History is at hand to give us this salutary lesson.
Where is now to-day the <i>ville-pedaille</i>, the villains and
base-tenants, fit only to drain ditches and to be stripped to
the skin? Inventing, governing, making laws for, and
gradually transforming our globe, devastated by the
<i>superior and only capable</i> species, into a smiling and
peaceful domain.</p>

<p>Upon all classification of the human species, whether
in castes, in classes, or in sexes, are based three wrongs.</p>

<p>The first is to make it a crime in the individual degraded
into the lower series, that he does not resemble
the conventional type that has been formed of this
series, while the so called superior being is not required to
resemble his type; thus a weak, cowardly, unintelligent
man, a <i>man milliner</i> or an <i>embroiderer</i>, is none the less a
man, while a virago, a firm and courageous woman, a
great queen, a woman philosopher are not women, but
men whom none love and who are given over as a prey
to wild beasts, jealous, effeminate men, to devour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"> 245</a></span>
The second wrong is to take advantage of the conventional
type to deform the being classed in the inferior
series in order to kill his energies and to hinder his
progress. Then, to attain this end, education, social
surroundings are organized, prejudices are invented; and
so successfully is this done in general that the oppressed,
ignorant of himself, believes himself really of an inferior
nature, resigns himself to his chains, and is even indignant
at the rebellion of those of his series who are too
energetic and individual not to react against the part
to which social imbecility has condemned them.</p>

<p>The third wrong is to take advantage of the state of
debasement to which the oppressed has been reduced,
to calumniate him and deny his rights; men exclaim,
Look! See the serf! see the slave! see the negro! see
the workingman! see woman! What rights would you
grant these inferior and feeble natures? <i>They are incapable
of knowing and ruling themselves</i>: we must
therefore think for them, wish for them, and govern
them.</p>

<p>Ah no, gentlemen, these are not men and women;
they are the deplorable results of your selfishness, of
your frightful spirit of domination, of your imbecility....
If there were infernal gods, I should devote
you to them relentlessly with all my heart. Instead of
calumniating your fellows that you may preserve your
privileges, give them instruction and liberty; then only
will you have the right to pass judgment on their nature:
for we can only know the nature of a human
being when it has become freely developed in equality.</p>

<p>I think that I have justified my repugnance to give a
classification of the sexes, both by the impossibility of
actually establishing a reasonable one, and by the very
legitimate fear of the bad use that would be made of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"> 246</a></span>
But it will be objected, and not without reason, that
a classification is necessary for social practice.</p>

<p>I consent to it with all my heart, since I have reserved
my positions, and proved the worthlessness of
existing classifications.</p>

<p>As it is my principle that the function should fall to
the functionary who proves his capacity, I say that at
present, through the difference of education, man and
woman have distinct functions; and that we must give
to the latter the place that in general she deserves.</p>

<p>I add that it is a violation of the natural right of woman
to form her with a view to certain functions to
which she is destined; she should in all respects enjoy
the rights common to all; it cannot rightfully be said to
her any more than to man, "your sex cannot do that, cannot
pretend to that;" if it does it and pretends to it, it is
because the sex can do it and pretend to it; if it could
not, it would not do it; the first right is liberty, the
first duty, the culture of one's aptitudes, the development
of his reason and his power of usefulness: if a
god should affirm the contrary, not conscience, but the
god would speak falsely.</p>

<p>Let woman take the place therefore that is suited to
her present development, but let her never cease to remember
that this place is not a fixed point, and that she
should continually strive to mount upwards until, her
peculiar nature revealing itself through equality of education,
instruction, right and duty, she takes her rightful
place by the side of man and on a level with him.</p>

<p>Let her laugh at all the utopian follies elaborated
concerning her nature, her functions determined for
eternity, and remember that she is not what nature, but
what subjection, prejudice, ignorance has made her; let
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"> 247</a></span>
her escape from all her chains, and no longer permit
herself to be intimidated and debased.</p>

<p>Thus, gentlemen, all my ideas on the nature and
functions of woman may be summed up in these few
propositions:</p>

<p>I believe, because a physiological deduction authorizes
me to do so, that general humanity common to both
sexes is stamped by sexuality.</p>

<p>In <i>fact</i>, I know not, and you know no better than I,
what are the true characteristics arising from the distinction
of the sexes, and I believe that they can be revealed
only by liberty in equality, parity of instruction
and of education.</p>

<p>In social practice, functions should belong to those
who can perform them: woman therefore should perform
those functions for which she shows herself qualified,
and society should become so organized that this may
be possible.</p>

<p>What are these functions relative to her degree of
present development? I will tell you directly.</p>

<div class="section">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"> 248</a></span></p>
<p class="titre">LOVE; ITS FUNCTION IN HUMANITY.<br />
<span class="medium">I.</span></p>
</div>

<p>You tell the child that lies, "it is wrong to deceive;
you would not wish others to deceive you."</p>

<p>You tell the child that pilfers, "it is wrong to steal;
you would not wish others to steal from you."</p>

<p>You tell the child that takes advantage of his strength
and knowledge to torment his younger companion; "you
would not wish others to do these things to you;
you are wicked and cowardly."</p>

<p>These are good lessons. Why then, when the child
has become a young man, do you say: <i>Young men must
sow their wild oats</i>?</p>

<p><i>To sow their wild oats</i> is to deceive young girls, to
destroy their future, to practice adultery, to keep mistresses,
to visit brothels.</p>

<p>Yet mothers, women thus consent to the profanation
of their sex!</p>

<p>Those who forbade their child to steal a toy, permit
him to steal the honor and repose of human beings!</p>

<p>Those who shamed their son for falsehood, permit
him to deceive poor young girls!</p>

<p>Those who made it a crime in their son to oppress
those weaker than themselves, permit him to be oppressive
and perfidious toward women!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"> 249</a></span>
Then they complain later that their sons treat them
ill; that they dishonor and ruin themselves;</p>

<p>That they desire the death of their parents, in order
to enrich the usurers from whom they have borrowed
money to maintain their mistresses in luxury.</p>

<p>They complain that they destroy their health, and
give their mothers puny grandchildren, for whose existence
they are in continual anxiety.</p>

<p>Ah! ladies, you have only what you deserve; bear
the weight of a joint responsibility which you cannot
escape. You authorized your sons to sow their wild
oats; endure the consequences.</p>

<p>But a mother cannot be the confident of her son, it
is said.</p>

<p>Why not, madam, if you have brought him up in
such a way as to have no dishonorable confidence to
make to you.</p>

<p>He would have none to make, if you had accustomed
him to conquer himself, to respect every woman as
though she were his mother, every young girl as though
she were his sister; to treat others as he would think it
right to be treated by them; if you had fully inculcated
on him that there is but one system of morality,
which both sexes are equally bound to obey; if
you had caused him to honor, love and practice labor;
if you had told him that we live to improve ourselves,
to practise justice and kindness, and to render back to
humanity what it does for us in protecting us, enlightening
us, rendering us moral, surrounding us with security
and comfort; that in fine our glory lies in subjecting
ourselves to the great law of Duty.</p>

<p>If you had reared him in this manner, madam, on
surprising in your son the first signs of the ardent attraction
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"> 250</a></span>
that man feels toward the other sex, far from
abandoning the education of this instinct to the chances
of inexperience, you would do for it what you did for
the others; you would teach the young man to subject it
to a wise discipline.</p>

<p>Instead of repeating the stupidly atrocious phrase;
<i>young men must sow their wild oats</i>, you would have
taken your son's hand affectionately in your own, and,
looking in his face, would have said: "My child, Nature
decrees that a woman should henceforth attract you
more strongly than I, and should maintain or destroy
what I have so laboriously built up: I do not murmur
at this; it must be so. But my affection and duty require
me to enlighten you in this grave juncture. Tell
me, if a young man, to satisfy the instinct which is now
awakening in you, should corrupt your sister, should
sacrifice her life, what would you think of him? what
would you do?"</p>

<p>The young man, accustomed from childhood to practise
Justice, would not fail to reply: "I should think him
depraved and cowardly. Would he not be punished?"</p>

<p>"No, my son, the seducer is not punished by the law."</p>

<p>"Well! I would kill him, for my right of justice reverts
to me when the law makes no provision."</p>

<p>"Right, my child. Then you will be neither depraved
nor cowardly with respect to any young girl; you will
not deserve the sentence which you have pronounced;
namely, death. You will respect all young girls and
women as you would wish your sister, your daughter to
be respected.</p>

<p>"Another question: what would you think of a man
who should persuade me to betray your father; who
should rob him of my heart and cares; who should draw
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"> 251</a></span>
me aside from the grave duties of maternity? What
would you think of the man who should act thus with
respect to your own companion?"</p>

<p>"I would judge him like the former and would treat
him no better."</p>

<p>"Right again. Then you will respect all married
women as you would wish your mother and your wife
to be respected; and if you should meet any one towards
whom you should feel attracted, or who should be disloyal
enough to seek to attract you, you will shun her:
for flight is the sole remedy for passion.</p>

<p>"A multitude of women, innocent at first, have been
turned aside from the right path by men who do not
think as you do. They now avenge themselves upon your
sex for the evil it has done them. They corrupt and
ruin men who, in their company, lose all sense of morality,
who learn to laugh at what you believe and venerate,
and undermine and destroy their health. Do you
feel the deplorable courage to expose yourself to such
risks?"</p>

<p>The young man, practised from childhood to subject
his inclinations to reason and justice, would reply: "No,
mother, I will not do what I would not wish my companion
to do; I will neither degrade myself morally,
nor destroy my health, nor contribute my share towards
perpetuating a state of things which degrades the sex
to which belongs my mother, my sister, my wife and my
daughters, should I be so happy as to possess them.</p>

<p>"I acknowledge frankly that I foresee a violent struggle
with myself, but, thanks to the moral training to
which you have accustomed me, thanks to the ideal of
destiny which you have given me, which I have accepted
in the plenitude of my reason, and which my duty
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"> 252</a></span>
marks out for me, I do not despair of subduing myself."&mdash;"This
victory will be less difficult to obtain, if you
employ yourself usefully and seriously; for you will
thus attract your vitality to the superior regions of the
brain. You will do wisely to add to this, much physical
exercise; to abstain from too substantial a diet, and
especially from stimulating drinks! you know the reaction
of the physical upon the moral system. Carefully
avoid licentious reading and improper conversation; give
a place in your mind to the virgin who will be united
to you; think and act as if in her presence; it will
guard you and keep you pure. This sweet ideal will
strengthen you against temptation, and contribute greatly
to render you insensible towards those women who
should have no place in your heart."</p>

<p>"Love, my child, is a thing most serious in its results;
for the beings whom it unites become modified by each
other; it leaves its traces, however short may be its duration.</p>

<p>"Its end is Marriage, one of the ends of which is the
continuity of the species. Now, you know the effects
of solidarity of blood; it is most important therefore
that you should choose for your companion a woman
whose character, morals and principles are in unison with
your own; not only for your happiness, but for the <i>organization</i>
of your children, the harmony of their nature
and conduct.</p>

<p>"If passion does not leave you sufficiently free in your
judgment, come to me: I will see for you, and if I say:
my son, this woman will debase you, will cause you to
commit faults; be sure that your children will have
evil propensities; she is not adapted to rear them according
to your ideal, which she will never accept, because
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"> 253</a></span>
she is vain and selfish; if I tell you this, I know,
my son, that whatever may be your suffering, you will
renounce a woman whom you would cease to love after
a few months' union, and will prefer a transient sadness
to a life of unhappiness."</p>

<p class="subh">II.</p>

<p>The mother who has just shown her son why love
should be subjected to Reason and Justice, and has
pointed out to him what he should do to subdue its animal
phase, perceives also the awakening of this instinct
in her daughter. She wins her attention and gains her
confidence by revealing to her what is passing within her
heart, telling her that, at her age, she felt the same.</p>

<p>"Hitherto," continues she, "you have been but a child;
your career as a woman is now commencing. You desire
the affection of a man, and your heart is moved at
the sweet thought of becoming a mother. Do not
blush, my daughter; it is lawful, on condition that your
desires are made subject to Reason and the law of Duty.</p>

<p>"Many snares will be spread before your steps; for
men of all ages address to a young girl innumerable
flattering speeches, and surround her with homage
which renders her vain and coquettish if she has the
weakness to suffer herself to be intoxicated thereby.
Persuade yourself fully that all this adoration is not addressed
to you individually, but to your youth, to the
brightness of your eyes, to the freshness of your complexion,
and that, were you far better than you are and
far superior in intellect, these men would be ceremoniously
and frigidly polite, were you thirty years older.
This thought present in your mind will make you smile
at their frivolous and common-place jargon, and will
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"> 254</a></span>
preserve you from many weaknesses, such as rivalry of
dress, petty jealousies, and the ridiculous blunder of
playing the young girl at fifty.</p>

<p>"As you can espouse but one man, it is sufficient to
be loved by one in the manner that you wish. A woman
who comports herself voluntarily so as to captivate
the hearts of many men, and leaves each to believe
that she prefers him above all, is an unworthy coquette,
who sins against Justice and Kindness: against Justice,
inasmuch as she demands a sentiment for which she can
make no return; as she acts towards others as she
would think it unjust that others should act towards her;
against Kindness, inasmuch as she risks causing suffering
to sincere hearts and sacrificing their repose to a
pleasurable impulse of vanity: such a woman, my
child, is contemptible; she is a dangerous enemy of her
sex; first, because she gives a bad opinion of it; next,
because she is an enemy to the repose of other women;
I know that you are too ingenuous, too true and too
worthy to fear that you will fall into such errors.</p>

<p>"You have acknowledged to me that your young imagination
had pictured to itself a man. Far from banishing
this ideal, let it be always present to your mind,
much less in its physical aspect than in that of intellect,
morality and industry. This image will do more to
keep you safe than all my counsels, than all the surveillance
that I might, but never would exercise over you,
because this would be unworthy of us both.</p>

<p>"Do not forget however that an ideal is absolute; that
the reality is always defective; do not therefore seek in
the man to whom you shall give your heart, a realization
of the ideal, but the qualities and faculties which,
with your aid, will permit him to approximate to what
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"> 255</a></span>
you wish to see him. You yourself are the ideal of a
man, not such as you are, but such as he will aid you
to become.</p>

<p>"I dwell upon this point, my daughter, because nothing
is more dangerous than to insist on finding the ideal
in the reality; this makes us over difficult and lacking
in indulgence; and, if we have a lively imagination and
little reason, renders us unhappy and involves us in innumerable
errors.</p>

<p>You know and feel that the end of love is Marriage;
now one of your duties as lover and spouse is the improvement
of the one to whom you shall be united.
You will stand with him in two different relations! first
as his betrothed, afterwards as his wife. Your modifying
power will, in the first case, be exercised in a direct
proportion to his desire to please and to be worthy of
you; in the second, in proportion to his confidence, esteem
and affection for you. In the first case, he will <i>wish</i>
to modify himself; in the second, he will do so without
knowing it."</p>

<p>"What, mother, will he not always love me the same?"</p>

<p>"Love, my child, undergoes transformations which we
should expect and to which we should submit; in the
beginning it is a fever of the soul; but fever is a condition
which cannot last without destroying life. Your
husband, while loving you perhaps more deeply, will
love you less ardently than before Marriage. Your
love will become transformed, why shall not his be the
same?</p>

<p>"You cannot imagine how much trouble results from
the ignorance of women on this point, and from the
vain pursuit of the ideal in love. Many women, believing
that their husband loves them no longer because
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"> 256</a></span>
he loves them in a different manner, become detached
from him, suffer, and betray their duties; others, dreaming
of perfection in the loved one, fancy that they have
found it, and becoming disabused after the fever has
past, quit him, accusing him of having deceived them;
they love others with the same illusion, followed by the
same disenchantment, until age creeps on without curing
them of the chimera. Lastly, there are others who,
comprehending only the first period of love, cease to
love the man who has passed beyond it, and pursue another
love which will bring them the same fever; these,
as you comprehend, have not the slightest idea of woman's
grave duties in Love.</p>

<p>"What I have just said of women is equally true of
men. You will avoid these dangers, my daughter, you
who have been accustomed from childhood to submit to
reason; who know that all reality is imperfect, that
habit weakens sentiment, you will therefore take the
man who suits you, as he is, designing to improve him
and to render him happy, knowing in advance that his
love will change without becoming extinguished, if you
succeed in gaining his affection, confidence and esteem,
so that he will find in you good counsel, peace, assistance
and security. You are too pure, my daughter, to
foresee all the snares that will be spread for you. It
belongs to me therefore to arm your youthful prudence:
You will perhaps encounter men married or betrothed
who, according to the common expression, <i>will pay
court to you</i>, and will utter innumerable sophisms to
justify their conduct."</p>

<p>"Their sophisms would fall to the ground before the
simple answer: Sir, as I should be driven to despair if
another woman should rob me of him whom I loved,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"> 257</a></span>
as I should despise and hate her, all your compliments
cannot persuade me that it is right for me to do what I
would not that others should do to me. If you return
to the subject, I shall inform the person interested.</p>

<p>"Right, my child: but if a young man who was free
should speak of love, and urge you to write to him in
secret?"</p>

<p>"Might he not have good reason for acting in this
manner?"</p>

<p>"None, my child. You must know that men are exceedingly
corrupt; that many among them eschew marriage,
flit from one woman to another, take advantage
of our credulity, and make use of the most impassioned
language to lead us in the way of shame and perdition.
Now, my child, know besides that we bear the weight of
men's faults as well as of our own; the verbal and
written promises of a man bind him to nothing. If,
suffering yourself to be led astray, you should become
a mother, the child would remain your charge; and
you could no longer hope for marriage; I say nothing
of our grief and shame, nor of the terrible risks to
which you would expose your brother, who might perish
in punishing the vile seducer whom the law does
not touch. If a man seeks you therefore unknown to
us, be sure that it is because his intentions are evil; that
he considers you as a toy which he purposes to break when
it ceases to amuse him. Now, my daughter, you know
that woman is created to be the worthy companion of
man; that she is not born to be sacrificed to him as an
object of pleasure. Instead therefore of suffering yourself
to be seduced, profit by the influence over men
which is given you by your beauty and grace, to recall
them to their duties: in this manner, you may be the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"> 258</a></span>
means of saving many women; you will give a favorable
opinion of your sex, and will prepare a good example
for your daughter by setting one to your companions,
many of whom will follow it in order to share in the
esteem that will surround you; always remember that
our acts not only injure ourselves, but we have a joint
responsibility with others, and consequently no one can
be lost or saved alone.</p>

<p>"One word more, my child. In your uncertainties, do
not hesitate to confide your troubles to me; do not say,
My mother is too reasonable to understand me in this.
Was it not by becoming a child again in order to comprehend
you, that I fulfilled my sacred task of instructor?
be persuaded that it will not be more difficult for
me to become a young girl again in order to comprehend,
while remaining a tender and experienced mother
to advise you.</p>

<p>"You are free: I am not your censor, but your elder
sister, who loves you with devotion and desires your
happiness before all things. As a recompense for my
love and my long-continued cares, I only ask to be your
best friend; that is, the one in whose presence you will
think and speak aloud. Is this asking too much of you,
who are my joy and crown."</p>

<p>This is the way, ladies, in which the woman who has
attained majority, strives to educate the world in Love.</p>

<p class="subh">III.</p>

<p>The young girl and young man enter into society.
The prudent mother knows that it is gently insinuated
to her son that she is a <i>prude</i>, a <i>dotard</i> who knows nothing
of the passions; who does not suspect that <i>everything
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"> 259</a></span>
in nature is good</i>, and should be respected; and
who has read the history of our species to so little purpose
that she has not perceived that humanity has love
in all forms: the <i>polygamic</i> and <i>polyandric</i>, and even
... the <i>ambiguous</i>.</p>

<p>She knows also, that he is told that the satisfaction of
the animal instinct is necessary to the <i>health</i> of man,
and that brothels are places of public utility.</p>

<p>She knows, lastly, that young and giddy girls, with
lax principles, make dangerous confidences to her
daughter.</p>

<p>It is time, in opposition to these lax doctrines and
pernicious examples, to give to her children the philosophy
of Love. According to her method, she suffers is
to elucidate itself.</p>

<p><span class="cap">S</span><span class="smallc">ON.</span> It is evidently in order to incite to action the
organs which procure to the organism the elements
adapted to <i>produce</i> blood.</p>

<p><span class="cap">D</span><span class="smallc">AUGHTER.</span> For the <i>production</i> of young to perpetuate

<p><span class="cap">M</span><span class="smallc">OTHER.</span> Why do the females, and often males
among animals experience an inclination or attraction
to take care of the young?</p>

<p><span class="cap">D</span><span class="smallc">AUGHTER.</span> In order to preserve them and to educate
them as far as is in their power, that they may be
able to provide for themselves.</p>

<p><span class="cap">M</span><span class="smallc">OTHER.</span> Are you quite sure, my children, that the
end of these attractions is not the attraction itself, the
procurement of a pleasure?</p>

<p><span class="cap">S</span><span class="smallc">ON.</span> The pleasure seems to me only the means of
impelling the being to fulfill a necessary or useful function.
Thus the end of our scientific, artistic and industrial
inclinations or attractions is not the pleasure which
we take in their satisfaction, but the <i>production</i> of
science, art and industry.</p>

<p><span class="cap">D</span><span class="smallc">AUGHTER.</span> That is, the increase and progress of our
intellect through the knowledge of the laws of Nature,
in order to modify this nature with a view to our wants
and pleasures.</p>

due?</p>

<p><span class="cap">S</span><span class="smallc">ON.</span> To our attraction for our fellow beings.</p>

<p><span class="cap">D</span><span class="smallc">AUGHTER.</span> This attraction is the father of Justice
and of Goodness: it <i>produces</i> them.</p>

<p><span class="cap">M</span><span class="smallc">OTHER.</span> Will you generalize the character of this
inclination or attraction in accordance with what we
have just said?</p>

<p><span class="cap">S</span><span class="smallc">ON.</span> The end of all attraction or inclination is the
<i>production</i>, <i>progress</i> and <i>preservation</i> of beings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"> 261</a></span>
<span class="cap">M</span><span class="smallc">OTHER.</span> Are all instincts good which are merely inclinations
or attractions?</p>

<p><span class="cap">S</span><span class="smallc">ON.</span> For animals, which are subject to fatality, they
are; because they tend directly to their end, without
ever appearing to deviate from it. In our species, they
are good in principle, if we regard their end; but they
may become evil through the deviation to which our
liberty subjects them.</p>

<p><span class="cap">M</span><span class="smallc">OTHER.</span> By what token can we know that our instinct
has a right tendency?</p>

<p><span class="cap">D</span><span class="smallc">AUGHTER.</span> By comparing its use with its end; by assuring
ourselves that this use is not prejudicial to the
practice of justice, that it does not detract from the
right of any of our faculties; that is, that it disturbs
neither our individual harmony nor that of others; for
it is on these conditions alone that it can coöperate in
the realization of the social ideal.</p>

<p><span class="cap">M</span><span class="smallc">OTHER.</span> Very well. Now apply this general doctrine
to human love, my children.</p>

<p><span class="cap">S</span><span class="smallc">ON.</span> Since love is one of the forms of attraction,
and since the general end of attraction is the production,
progress and preservation of beings and species, it
is evident that human love should possess these characteristics.
Its principal function appears to me to be the
reproduction of the species.</p>

<p><span class="cap">D</span><span class="smallc">AUGHTER.</span> It seems to me, brother, that this is not
enough; since true husbands and wives do not cease to
love each other after this end has been fulfilled, and
since persons may love without having children.</p>

<p><span class="cap">M</span><span class="smallc">OTHER.</span> You are right, my daughter; our faculties
being more numerous and more fully developed than
those of the animals, our love cannot be incomplete
like theirs; it cannot be of the same nature in our progressive
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"> 262</a></span>
species as in those species fatal and unprogressive
of themselves. In us, each faculty, properly
employed, aids in the improvement of all the rest,
wrongly employed, it interrupts our harmony and
lowers us; it is the same with our love. Or rather this
passion is the one that most of all causes us to grow or
to decline.</p>

<p>You know, my children, that humanity advances only
by forming itself an ideal and endeavoring to realize it.
Every passion has its ideal, which is modified by that
of the whole. In the beginning, man, in the animal
state, made the end of love the pleasure resulting from
the satisfaction of a wholly physical want: he cared
nothing for the most evident aim&mdash;progeny. A little
later, man less gross, loved woman for her beauty and
fruitfulness; this was the patriarchal age of love. Later
still, the Northern races wrought a change in this instinct;
love became decomposed, as it were; the lover
possessed the love of the soul; the woman was loved
not only for her beauty, but as the inspirer of lofty
deeds; the husband was the possessor of the body alone
and the children were the fruit of marriage; this was
the chivalrous age of love. Since pacific labor has been
organized and has gained a place in public opinion, love
has entered a new phase; many among the moderns
consider it as the initiative of labor. Some regard the
attraction of pleasure as playing the chief part in industrial
production, and leave full liberty to the attraction,
however inconsistent it may be; others preserve the
couple, and transform woman into the moving power
of action; the love that she inspires excites the efforts
of the worker.</p>

<p>The progress hitherto made by humanity is therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"> 263</a></span>
that love has now for its end the perpetuation of
the species, the modification of man by woman, and the
production of labor.</p>

<p>In a higher ideal of Justice, the sexes being equal in
rights, love will have a higher end; the spouses will
unite on account of conformity of principles, union of
hearts, wedding of intellects, common labor: love will
join them to double their strength, to modify them by
each other, from the friction of their hearts will be
struck out sentiments which neither would have had
alone; from the union of their intellects will be born
thoughts which neither would have had alone; from the
aid that they will lend each other in their common labor
will proceed works that neither would have accomplished
alone, as from the union of their whole being,
will be born new generations more perfect than the preceding
because they will be the product of the greatest
possible harmony. It will be only when woman shall
take her lawful place that humanity will see love in all
its splendor, and that this passion, subversive to-day in
inequality and incoherence, will become what it should
be; one of the great instruments of Progress.</p>

<p>We, my children, who are too rational to mistake the
means by which Nature impels us to accomplish her
designs for the designs themselves, will take care not to
fancy that the end of love is pleasure; on the other
hand, we have too much respect for equality to imagine
that it is for the benefit of one sex alone. We will remain
faithful to the ideal of our lofty destinies, in defining
love as the reciprocal attraction of man and woman
with the end of perpetuating the species, of improving
the partners mutually with respect to intellect
and feeling, and of advancing science, art and industry
by the labor of the pair.</p>

IV.</p>

<p>Sophists have told you, my son, that all our inclinations
are in Nature; that they are good and should be
respected.</p>

<p>You asked them doubtless whether the inclinations to
theft, to assassination, to violation, to anthropophagy,
which are in Nature, are good, and why, instead of respecting
them, society punishes their manifestation.</p>

<p>You demonstrated to them, I hope, that there is nothing
commendable in the exaggeration or the perversion
of instincts.</p>

<p>You demonstrated to them, I hope, that Nature is
brutal fatality against which we are bound to struggle
both within and without ourselves; that our Justice
and virtue are composed only of conquests made over it
in us, as all that constitutes our physical well-being is
only the result of conquests made over it outside of us.</p>

<p>These sophists have told you that love comes and
goes without our knowing how or wherefore; and that
we can no more command it to spring up than to endure.</p>

<p>This is true, my son, of the brutal desires of the
flesh, which is the passion of animals alone, and is
extinguished by possession.</p>

<p>This is also true of that complex passion which has
its seat in the imagination and the senses, and ends with
the illusion that is always of short duration.</p>

<p>But it is not true of genuine love; this sees both the
faults and the virtues of the loved one; but softens the
first and exalts the last, and hopes by degrees to put an
end to that which wounds it.</p>

<p>This sentiment which takes possession of the heart,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"> 265</a></span>
is patient; it bears lest it become effaced, it surrounds
itself with precautions in order to remain constant; if
it becomes extinct, it is not unconsciously: for we suffer
cruel tortures before resolving to cease to love.</p>

<p>You have been told that love is irrepressible; are we
then beings of fatality? This sophism renders man
cowardly and depraves him; for what is the use of
struggling against what we know to be unconquerable,
and why not sacrifice to it the best of our tendencies?
Examine the conduct of the partisans of such a doctrine.</p>

<p>The human ideal requires that they shall not do to
others what they would not think it just that others
should do to them; yet they seduce maidens, make
them mothers, and abandon them without caring about
the children born of these unions; without caring
whether the young mother commits suicide, dies of
grief, or becomes depraved; without caring whether
the parents go down to the grave.</p>

<p>Like deadly reptiles, they glide to the domestic fireside
of others, rob their friend of the affection of his
wife, and force him to labor for the children of adultery.</p>

<p>The woman who believes in irrepressible love breaks
her pledges to her husband; lives a life of deceit;
brings trouble and sorrow into the houses of other women,
whose lives are blighted by her.</p>

<p>It is in this way that those who practice this sophistry
fulfil their duty to be just, not to afflict their fellows,
to labor for the happiness and improvement of those
about them, to preserve the weak from oppression and
wrong. To this pretended irrepressibility of love, they
sacrifice Justice, goodness, the happiness, repose and
honor of others; lead them into the path of dissipation;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"> 266</a></span>
bring dissolution into the family and society;
in a word, offer up as a sacrifice to animal instinct,
moral sense and reason.</p>

<p>You have also been told that every species of love is
found in Nature; the polyamic and polygandric, as
well as that of the constant pair.</p>

<p>Yes, my child, every species of love is found in Nature,
as is every species of vice and every species of
virtue. But you know that it is not enough that a thing
exists within us to prove it to be good; it must be in
conformity with the ideal of our destiny, with our harmony:
it is wrong in the opposite case.</p>

<p>Love, such as we have defined it, needs duration and
equality; duration, because we do not become modified
in a few months; because we do not accomplish great
works in a few months; because we do not rear children
in a few months; duration is so truly an aspiration of
love, that it imagines that eternity will hardly suffice
for it. It must have equality; division is hateful to it;
it will therefore have a unit for a unit, both male and
female. Now polygamy and polyandria are the negation
of equality, of dignity in love.</p>

<p>Let us consider the effects of these two deviations of
instinct.</p>

<p>Oriental polygamy renders human beings profoundly
unequal, transforms women into cattle, mutilates thousands
of men to guard the harems, depraves the possessor
of women by despotism and cruelty, concentrates all
his vitality upon a single instinct at the expense of intellect,
reason and activity; whence it follows that he
is lost to science, art, industry, society according to
right: that he submits without repugnance to despotism,
and passively extends his neck to the halter. There,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"> 267</a></span>
no influence is wielded by woman, who is subjected to
designed enervation, who is depraved in as hideous a
manner as the eunuch, her keeper. Thus, inequality in
love and in right, abandonment of art, science and industry,
intellectual and physical enervation, debasement
of the moral sense&mdash;such are vices inherent to the polygamy
of the East. You see that this is far from the
ideal of our destinies.</p>

<p>In our West, polygamy <i>de facto</i> produces the cattle
of the brothel, legions of courtesans who ruin families.
As many of these women are diseased, they infect those
who associate with them with fearful maladies which
undermine their constitutions, and thus pave the way
for puny offspring, consequently, for weak minds and
feeble intellects. I appeal for proof to the conscription;
never were so many exemptions seen as now on account
of under size, although the standard has been lowered,
never were so many exemptions seen as now for constitutional
imperfections and acquired disease.</p>

<p>To vitiate the generation in its germ is not the only
crime of our polygamy; it enervates those who practice
it, for nothing leads to excess, consequently to enervation,
so much as the change of relations. On the
other hand, our polygamists become transformed into
machines of sensation; then intellect grows weak; they
become stupid and selfish. Look at the pitiable young
men of the present time, emaciated by their vices and
by those of their sires; scoffers, faithless, jesting at the
most sacred things, despising, not only the corrupt women,
their worthy companions, but also the whole sex
to which their mothers belong; look at them; so gross
as to sicken the observer, nothing longer commands
their respect; they thrust aside gray haired women
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"> 268</a></span>
from the sidewalk into the gutter; they are impertinent
to old men; they put young girls to the blush with their
cynical speeches; polygamy has rendered them ignoble,
and has destroyed our native urbanity as well as all
dignity.</p>

<p>They will tell you that women are but little better
than they. But this result becomes inevitable in a
country in which women are not kept in seclusion.
Polyandria becomes the necessary companion of polygamy;
for since men consider themselves at liberty to
have more than one woman, why should women consider
themselves forbidden to have more than one man?</p>

<p>Finally, my son, the results of irrepressible love,
Polygamy and Polyandria in our Western country are:</p>

<p>The seduction and corruption of women;</p>

<p>Adultery, debasement of character; the moral and
intellectual enfeebling of both sexes;</p>

<p>The enervation and degeneracy of the race;</p>

<p>Falsehood, deceit, cruelty, injustice of every kind,
the use of woman by man for her beauty, that of man
by woman for his money or position;</p>

<p>The dissolution and ruin of the family;</p>

<p>Several thousand illegitimate children annually, without
counting abortions;</p>

<p>Such is the value of these theories put in practice.</p>

<p>Is this in conformity with our ideal of human love?
Is it in conformity with our ideal of human destiny,
which requires that we shall progress and cause others
to progress in good; that we shall practice Justice and
Goodness?</p>

<p>A word more, and we have done.</p>

<p>When Rome had ceased to believe in chastity, in the
sacredness of oaths; when she wallowed in polygamic
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"> 269</a></span>
and polyandric customs; when she took pleasure for
her end, tyranny appeared. Nothing was more natural:
man binds captive those only who have first suffered
themselves to be bound under the yoke of bestial instinct:
he who knows how to govern himself does not
yield obedience to man; he bows only before the law
when it is the expression of Reason.</p>

<p>Remember, my son, that we are powerful only
through chastity; only thus can we produce great
works in science, art and industry; only thus can we
practice Justice, be worthy of liberty. Outside of chastity,
there is nothing but degradation, injustice, impotence,
slavery; and every nation that forsakes it falls
from the arms of despotism into the grave.</p>

<p>Do not suffer yourself therefore to be moved by modern
sophisms, have always before your thoughts your
obligations as a moral and a free being, your duties as a
member of humanity; subject all that is within you to
Reason, to Justice, to the sentiment of your dignity, and
live like a man, not like a brute.</p>

MARRIAGE, A DIALOGUE.<br />
<span class="medium">I</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> We are about to speak of Marriage from
the stand point of the modern ideal&mdash;how do you define
it?</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Love, sanctioned by Society.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> Do you consider Marriage as indissoluble?</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Before the law, I do not; but at the moment
of their union, the spouses should have full confidence
that the bond will never be dissolved.</p>

<p>I believe that Marriage becomes indissoluble by the
will alone of the spouses; that it can be so only in this
manner.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> What part do you assign to Society in Marriage?</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> You shall fix it yourself after recalling our
principles.</p>

<p>If man and woman are free beings at any period
of their life, they cannot <i>legally and validly</i> lose their
liberty.</p>

<p>If man and woman are beings socially equal in any
of their relations, the one cannot <i>legally, validly</i> be
subordinated to the other.</p>

<p>If the continual end of the human being is to become
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"> 271</a></span>
perfected through liberty, and to seek happiness, no law
can legitimately, <i>validly</i> turn him aside from its pursuit.</p>

<p>If the end of society should be to render individuals
<i>equal</i> it cannot, under penalty of forfeiting its mission,
constitute inequality of persons and of rights.</p>

<p>If Society cannot without iniquity enter the domain
of individual liberty, it cannot <i>lawfully, validly</i> prescribe
duties that pertain only to the jurisdiction of the
conscience, and annul moral liberty.</p>

<p>Now draw your conclusions.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> From these principles, it follows that man
and woman should remain free and equal in Marriage;
that Society has no right to intervene in their association
except to render them equal; that it has no right
to prescribe to them duties which proceed only from
love, nor consequently to punish their violation, that it
cannot in principle grant or refuse divorce, because it
belongs to the husband and wife alone to know whether
it is useful for their happiness and progress to be separated
from each other.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Your conclusions are right, but if Society
has no right over the body or the soul of the husband
and wife in their capacity of spouses, if it cannot without
abuse of power interfere in any of their intimate
relations, it is its right and duty to intervene in Marriage
as regards interests and children.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> In fact, in the union of the sexes, there is
not merely an association of two free and equal persons,
but also a partnership of capital and labor; then,
from the marriage, children are born for whose education,
occupation and subsistence it is necessary to provide.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Now, the general protection of material
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"> 272</a></span>
interests and of the rising generation devolves of right
upon Society. In the sight of the law, the husband
and wife ought to be regarded only as partners, engaging
to employ a certain share of capital, together with
their labor, for a definite purpose. Society takes note
only of a contract of interests, the execution of which
it guarantees like that of any other contract, and the
breach of which it makes public, should it take place by
the wish of the parties interested. On the other hand,
the education of the rising generation is a question of
life and death to Society. The children being free with
respect to development, and liable to be useful or injurious
to their fellow citizens according to the training
which they have received, society has a right to watch
over them, to secure their material support, their moral
future, to fix the age of marriage, to entrust the children
to the more deserving parent in case of separation,
and if both are unworthy, to take them away entirely.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> Do you not go a little too far; on the one
hand, do not children belong to their parents, on the
other, may not Society err with respect to the choice of
the principles to be instilled in them?</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Children do not belong to their parents because
they are not <span class="smallc">THINGS</span>: to those who obstinately
persist in believing them <i>property</i>, we say that Society
has the right of dispossession for the public good. Then
the social right over children is limited so far as principles
are concerned to those of morality. Society has
no right over religious beliefs which belong to the domain
of spiritual jurisdiction. The power that should
take away children from their parents because they
were not of a certain religious faith would be guilty of
despotism, and would merit universal execration. If
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"> 273</a></span>
you say that Society has no right to impose a dogma
upon children, you speak truly; but I cannot conceive
how you can entertain the thought of forbidding it the
right to teach them, even against the will of their parents,
enlightening science, purifying morality. Is it not
the duty of society to secure the progress of its members,
and can any one have a right to keep a human being
in ignorance and evil?</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> You are right, and I condemn myself. Let
us return to Marriage. I see with pleasure that you
differ in opinion from a number of modern innovators
who deny the lawfulness of social interference in the
union of the sexes.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> If the union were without protection, who
would suffer by it? Not men, but rather women and
children.</p>

<p>No one can compel a man to live with a woman
whom he has ceased to love; but he must be constrained
to fulfill his duties with respect to the children born of
this union, and to keep his business engagements: in
wronging his companion and escaping from the burdens
of paternity, he takes advantage of his liberty to the
detriment of others: Society has a right to prevent
this.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> So you do not grant to Society the right of
binding souls or bodies; but that of guaranteeing the
contract of Marriage, and the obligations of the spouses
towards their future children; of forcing them, in case
of separation, to fulfill this last obligation?</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Yes; thus in case of the rupture of the
marriage tie, society has only to state publicly the responsibilities
of the spouses, the number of children, and
the name of the parent on whom their guardianship devolves,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"> 274</a></span>
either by mutual consent or by social authority.
And in confining itself to this part, Society would do
more to prevent the separation of married couples than
by all that it has hitherto foolishly invented for the purpose.
The parties would be free to marry again; but
what woman would be willing to unite herself to a man
who was burdened with several children, or who had
treated his first companion unkindly? What man would
consent to wed a woman in the same position?</p>

<p>Do you not think that the difficulty that would be experienced
in contracting a new marriage would be a
curb on the inconstancy and bad conduct that lead to a
rupture?</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> I believe indeed that marriage, as you understand
it, would have more chances of duration than
ours: first, because it is our nature to cling most closely
to that which we may lose. I have often asked myself
why many men remain faithful to their mistresses and
treat them kindly, while they are disrespectful and unfaithful
to their wives; I have asked myself also why
many couples who had long lived happily together
when voluntarily united, were unhappy and often driven
to a legal separation when they had finally married;
and the only reason that I have been able to find is that
we set the most value on that which we know may
escape us. Man has more respect for a woman who
is not his legal property, his inferior, than for her who
is thus transformed by the law. Notwithstanding, it
must be acknowledged that your ideas appear eccentric.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Yet they are nothing more than an application
of our laws; indeed, do they not decree that
covenants can have <i>things</i> only, not <i>persons</i> for their object.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"> 275</a></span>
That Society <i>does not recognize vows</i>, and that
proceedings cannot be instituted against their violation?</p>

<p>Now the existing law of marriage <i>alienates</i> one of
the partners in favor of the other; the wife <i>belongs</i> to
the husband; she is in his <i>power</i>. What is such a contract,
if not the violation of the principle which affirms
that no covenant can be made involving persons? can it
be more lawful to alienate one's person by a contract
of slavery?</p>

<p>Some say that we are at liberty to dispose of our freedom
as we choose, even though it be to renounce it.
Indeed, we may do this, as we may commit suicide, but
to make use of our liberty to renounce it or to commit
suicide is much less to use aright than to violate the
laws of moral or physical nature; these are acts of insanity
which we should pity, but which we are not at
liberty to erect into a law.</p>

<p>Why does Society refuse to recognize vows and to
punish their violation, if not because it admits that it is
forbidden to penetrate into the jurisdiction of the conscience?
if not because it does not admit that an individual
may alienate his moral and intellectual being any
more than his body, and devote himself to immobility
when it is his duty, on the contrary, to go forward?</p>

<p>I ask then if this same Society is not inconsistent in
exacting perpetual vows from the husband and wife, in
exacting from the wife a vow of obedience, a tacit vow
to deliver up her person to the desires of the husband?</p>

<p>Is not the moral liberty of the spouses as worthy of
respect as that of nuns, priests and monks?</p>

<p>Have married persons more right in Nature and Reason,
to alienate their moral and intellectual being, their
liberty and their person than the celibates of the Church?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"> 276</a></span>
Another inconsistency of the law is that it declares
Marriage an association; the contract of Marriage is
therefore a contract of partnership. Now I ask whether,
in a single contract of this kind, it is enjoined by law on
one of the partners to <i>obey</i>, to be subjected to a <i>perpetual
minority</i>, to be <i>absorbed</i>?</p>

<p>I doubt not that the law would declare such a contract
between independent partners void; why then
does it legalize such a monstrosity in the partnership of
husband and wife? It is a relic of barbarism, as you
will see if you reflect on it.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> I hope that, through reason and necessity,
the law will be reformed sooner or later: but a reformation
which will not take place is that of the forms
of religious marriage, which prescribe to the spouses the
same oaths as the code, and like it, subject the wife to
the husband.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Well, what matters it to us, since, thanks
to liberty, the religious marriage is merely a benediction
with which we can dispense. Those who have a
disposition to go to the Church, the Temple, or the
Synagogue should have full liberty to receive the blessing
of their respective priests! this does not concern Society.
What we need is that, if afterward their vows
should not seem to them binding, social authority should
not make them obligatory; they have a right to be
absurd, but society has no right to impose absurdity on
them. Its duty is, on the contrary, to enlighten them,
and to render them free.</p>

<p class="subh">II.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> Those who subordinate woman in marriage
rest on the assertion that unity of direction, consequently
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"> 277</a></span>
a ruling power, is needed in the family; now,
your theory evidently destroys this ruling power.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> What is the ruling power? Practically,
it is manifested through the function of government.
Formerly, it was based upon two principles, now recognized
as radically false: <i>Divine right</i> and <i>inequality</i>.
It was the <i>right</i> of those who exercised it to call themselves
kings, autocrats, priests, men; it was the <i>duty</i>
therefore of the people, the church, woman to obey the
elect of God, their superiors by the grace of right delegated
from on high.</p>

<p>But in modern opinion, the ruling power is nothing
more than a function delegated by the parties interested
in order to execute their will.</p>

<p>It is not our business to inquire here whether this
modern interpretation has become incarnated in facts;
whether the old principle is not still struggling with the
new; whether the holders of political and familial authority
are not still making insane pretensions to divine
right; we have only to show what the notion of the
ruling power has become in the present state of thought
and feeling.</p>

<p>What will be the ruling power in marriage, in accordance
with modern opinion, if not the delegation by
one spouse to the other of the management of business
and of the family&mdash;a delegation of function; no longer
a right?</p>

<p>And if man and woman are socially equal in principle,
if the aptitudes, upon which all functions are based,
are not dependent on sex, by what right does society interfere
to give the authority either to the husband or
the wife?</p>

<p>If there is need of a ruling power in the household,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"> 278</a></span>
are not the parties themselves best capable of bestowing
it on the one who can best and most usefully exercise
it?</p>

<p>But among partners, is there really room for a ruling
power? No, there is room only for division of labor,
mutual understanding with respect to common interests.
To consult each other, to come to an agreement, to divide
the tasks, to remain master each of his own department;
this is what the spouses should do, and what
they do in general.</p>

<p>The law has so little part in our customs that to-day
things happen in this wise: many rich women translate
two articles of the Code as follows; <i>the husband shall
obey his wife, and shall follow her wherever she sees
fit to dwell or sojourn</i>. And the husbands obey, because
it would not do to offend a wife with a large dowry;
because it would make a scandal to thwart their
wife; because they need her, being unable, without dishonoring
themselves, to keep a mistress.</p>

<p>Husbands in the great centres of population escape
obedience through love outside of marriage; they lay
no restrictions on their part; Madame is free.</p>

<p>Among the working classes of the citizens and the
people, it is practically admitted that neither shall command,
and that the husband shall do nothing without
consulting his wife and obtaining her consent.</p>

<p>In all classes, if any husband is simple enough to
take his pretended right in earnest, he is cited as a bad
man, an intolerable despot whom his wife may hate and
deceive with a safe conscience; and it is a curious fact
that the greater part of the legal separations are for no
other cause at the bottom than the exercise of the
rights and prerogatives conceded to the husbands by
law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"> 279</a></span>
I ask you now, what is the use of maintaining against
reason and custom, an authority which does not exist,
or which is transferred to the spouse condemned to subjection.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> On this point, I am wholly of your opinion;
not a single woman of modern times takes the rights
of her husband in earnest. But your theory not only
attacks his authority; it also wages war against the indissolubility
of marriage, which it is affirmed, is necessary
to the dignity of this tie; to the happiness and future
of the children, to the morality of the family.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> I claim, on the contrary, that my theory
secures, as far as is humanly possible, the perpetuity
and purity of marriage. At present, when the knot is
tied, the spouses, no longer fearing to lose each other,
find in the absence of this fear the germ of a mutual
coolness; they may quarrel, be discourteous or unfaithful
to each other; there will be scandal, a legal separation
perhaps, but they are riveted together; they can
never become strangers. Contrast with this picture a
household in which the bond is dissoluble; all is
changed; the despotic or brutal husband represses his
evil propensities, because he knows that his companion,
whom after all he loves, would quit him and transfer to
another the attentions she lavishes on him; and that no
honest woman would be willing to take her place.</p>

<p>The husband disposed to be unfaithful would continue
in the path of duty, because his abandonment and
offences would alienate his wife, blast his reputation,
and prevent him from forming an honorable alliance.</p>

<p>The worn out profligate would no longer espouse the
dowry of a young girl, because he would know that,
promptly disenchanted, the young wife, instead of having
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"> 280</a></span>
recourse to adultery, would break the ill assorted
union.</p>

<p>The woman who should take advantage of her
dowry, of the necessity of her husband to remain faithful,
to tyrannise over him, would fear a divorce which
would throw the blame on her and condemn her to a
life of solitude.</p>

<p>A shrewish wife would no longer dare to inflict suffering
on her husband, or a coquette to deceive or torment
him; who would marry them after a separation?</p>

<p>Do you not see that free marriages are happier and
more lasting than any others?</p>

<p>Have you not yourself admitted that to separate the
parties in these unions, it often suffices to join them legally?</p>

<p>I know myself of a voluntary union that was very
happy during <i>twenty-two</i> years, and was dissolved by
separation at the end of three years of legal marriage;
I have known of many others of a shorter duration
which legality contributed to dissolve instead of rendering
eternal.</p>

<p>You would hardly believe how many married couples
reformed in their treatment of each other in 1848, when
they feared that the law of divorce might be accepted.
If the simple expedient of divorce has power to produce
good results, what may not be expected from a rational
law.</p>

<p>We need only to reflect in order to comprehend that
voluntary dissolubility, without social intervention,
would render unions better assorted, for it would be for
one's interest, for his own reputation, to enter into
them only with the moral conviction of being able to
preserve them; then only would no excuse be found for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"> 281</a></span>
infidelity; loyalty would make part of the relations of the
spouses. The law of perpetuity has perverted everything,
corrupted everything; on the side of the woman,
it favors, yes, necessitates stratagem; on the side of the
man, it favors brutality and despotism; it provokes on
both sides adultery, poisoning and assassination; and
leads to those separations which are daily increasing in
number, and which, by giving the lie to the indissolubility
of marriage, place the partners in a painful and
perilous situation, and bring in their train a host of
irregularities.</p>

<p>In fact, if the spouses are separated while young,
concubinage is their refuge. The man in this false position
finds many to excuse him; but the woman is
forced to conceal herself, to tremble at the thought of a
pregnancy and to make it disappear. Legal separation
leads the spouses not only to concubinage, to mutual
hatred, but causes the birth of thousands of children
whose future is compromised, destroyed by the fact of
their illegitimacy. Let the spouses be free in accordance
with their right, and all will fall into its proper
order, for all will be done openly and truly.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> But the future of the children?</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> The morality of the children is better insured
under the system of liberty than under that of
indissolubility, for they will not be witnesses for years of
the bitter contention and licentiousness which now render
them deceitful and vicious, and inspire them with
contempt or hatred for one of the authors of their being,
sometimes of both, when they do not take them
for models; if life in common becomes impossible to the
parents, which will be more rare under the law of liberty,
the children will not be subjected to the power of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"> 282</a></span>
those who violate the law of received morality; they
may see these parents contract a new alliance <i>as now</i>,
but this alliance will be honored by all.</p>

<p>From these unions children may be born <i>as now</i>, but
these children, instead of being cast into the hospital,
will share with the first the affection and inheritance
of their father or mother. The so-styled legitimate
children will lose in fortune, it is true; but they will
gain in good examples; many children who are now in
the category of the illegitimate will be ranked among the
former, and will be no longer condemned by desertion
to die young, or else to grovel in ignorance, vice and
misery; to see their brow branded with the fault of their
parents as of their own by a host of imbeciles and men
without heart, who have no other guarantee for what
they call their legitimacy than the presumption accorded
them by the law.</p>

<p class="subh">III.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> It will be long yet, perhaps, before collective
Reason comprehends liberty in the union of the
sexes as you do, and men will ascribe to themselves the
right not only of binding the interests, but the souls
and bodies of the spouses.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> As far as we can foresee, Society must
necessarily? pass through two stages to realize our opinion;
it must first grant divorce <i>for a declared cause</i>;
later it will grant divorce decreed in private on the petition
of one or both of the spouses. We will not take
up this last form of the rupture of the conjugal tie, but
that which is nearest us&mdash;divorce for a declared cause.</p>

<p>What are the reasons which you would consider valid
for a petition for divorce?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"> 283</a></span>
<span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> First, those which now give rise to separation
from bed and board: adultery of the wife, cruelty,
grave abuses, condemnation of one of the spouses to
punishment affecting the liberty or person, the fraudulent
management of the property by the husband; next, infidelity
of the husband, qualified adultery, incompatibility
of temper, notable vices, such as drunkenness,
gaming, etc.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Very well; these causes suffice.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> During the proceedings for divorce, the
wife should be as free as the husband. The child that
should be born to her after more than ten months' separation
should be reputed natural, even though the divorce
had not been pronounced; and should bear her name and
inherit from her like one of her legitimate children.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Who should take custody of the children
and the property during the proceedings?</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> The court should decide who should have
the care of the children, in accordance with the causes
for the petition for divorce and the testimony of the
parents, friends and neighbors.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> But if the spouses ask to be divorced only
on account of incompatibility of temper, and are both
honorable?</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> They should be requested to agree mutually
either to share the children, or to entrust them to one
of the two, or to give the younger children to the mother,
leaving the sons over fifteen to the father. The court,
besides, should appoint from the family of the mother,
a guardian to watch over the conduct of the father towards
the children left in his care; and from the family
of the father, a similar guardian to the mother and the
children remaining with her. This guardianship, which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"> 284</a></span>
should be strictly moral, should continue till the children
had attained majority.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> And in case the parents should be alike unworthy?</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> In such a case, which would seldom happen,
the judge, in behalf of society, should deprive them of
the custody of the children, and entrust it to a member
of the family of one of the parents, appointing a guardian
to watch over his conduct and protect the interests
of his ward from the family of the other.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Very well; I see with pleasure that you
are cured of the erroneous belief that the children <i>belong</i>
to the parents, and that you comprehend the high function
of society as the protector of minors.</p>

<p>During the suit for divorce, who shall have the control
of the property?</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> If the contract has been made under the
system of separation of property, and for paraphernalia,
there is no need of putting the question; each one will
manage his own.</p>

<p>But I am somewhat puzzled how to answer you in
case of communion of goods, or in case the capital is
embarked in a common business, carried on solely by
one of the parties. The present law does not seem to
me sufficiently to protect the interests of the wife in case
of separation.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Without entangling ourselves in a host of
individual cases which modify or contradict each other,
let us provide that in case of communion of goods, the
administration of the property shall be taken from the
spouse holding it if the petition for divorce be based on
his bad management, his dissipated habits, or his condemnation
to a penalty affecting his liberty or person;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"> 285</a></span>
that in all other cases, he shall make an inventory of
the property and the condition of the business; and a
person shall be appointed from the family of the spouse
excluded from the management to watch over the conduct
of the spouse to whom it is entrusted, who shall be
bound to pay alimony to the other until the divorce
shall be decreed.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> And if there is no fortune?</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Until the spouses become strangers, they
owe assistance to each other: the court should therefore
require the spouse that earns the more to aid the
other.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> How long a time should elapse between the
admission of the petition and the judgment of divorce?</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> A year, in order that the parties may have
time for reflection.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> The divorce being granted, and the ex-partners
restored to liberty, would you permit them to
marry others?</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Most assuredly; else what signifies our
arguments against separation?</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> What! the adulterous and brutal spouse,
he who has inflicted suffering on his partner, who has
been wholly in the wrong, should enjoy like the other
the privilege of marrying again? I confess that this
shocks me.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Because you are not sufficiently imbued
with the doctrines of liberty and the sentiment of right.
Marriage is the natural right of every adult; society
has no right therefore to prohibit it or to make it a privilege;
on the other hand, in every divorce, there is
wrong or the lack of something on either side with respect
to the other; the man or woman who commits
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"> 286</a></span>
adultery may be a model of fidelity to a partner better
suited to his or her temperament and disposition; he
who has been brutal and violent may be wholly different
with a wife possessing a different character; in
short, we repeat, to prohibit marriage is to permit libertinism,
and it is not the interest of society to pervert
itself. Both partners therefore should have a right to
marry, but the law should take care that all should be
informed of the burdens resting upon them by reason
of their first marriage, and know that they are divorced.
Consequently, society has a right to publish the bill of
divorce, and to require that the parties divorced should
provide for the necessities of their minor children, and
that the bill of divorce, joined to the one setting forth
this obligation, should accompany the publication of the
bans of a new marriage; in this, there is neither injustice
nor abuse of power; for each one will submit
to the consequence of what he has done in perfect freedom.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> And would you not fix the number of times
that a divorced person might re-marry?</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Why fix it? do you fix the number of
times that a widow or widower may marry again?</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> But a libertine, a bad man might marry
ten times, and thus render ten women unhappy.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> What are you talking of! do you seriously
believe that there would be a woman insane enough to
marry a man <i>nine times</i> divorced, a man obliged to accompany
the publication of his bans with nine bills of
divorce, with nine judgements compelling him to pay
so much yearly for the support of seven, eight or nine
children. Do you seriously believe that a woman
would consent to become the companion of such a man!
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"> 287</a></span>
This man might indeed marry twice&mdash;but three times!
do you think that it would be possible?</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> You are right, and on reflection, the measures
which you advocate appear perhaps severe.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> I know it; but our aim is not to favor divorces
nor subsequent unions; but, on the contrary, to
prevent the former as far as possible by the difficulties
of forming the latter. Now for this it is not necessary
to restrict the liberty of the individual, but to render
him responsible for his acts, and to rivet the chain that
he has forged for himself in such a manner that he can
neither cast it aside nor lay the burden of it on others
unless they are duly warned of it and consent thereto.</p>

<p class="subh">IV.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> Ought society to permit unions disproportioned
in age? Is it not to expose a woman to adultery,
to marry her at seventeen or eighteen to a man of
thirty, forty or even fifty years of age? What harmony
of sentiments and views can exist at that time between
the spouses? The wife sees in her husband a
sort of father, whom notwithstanding she can neither
love nor respect like a father, and she remains a minor
all her life.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> These unions are very prejudicial to woman
and the race, and they would be for the most part
averted, if the law should fix the marriageable age at
twenty-four or twenty-five for both sexes. At seventeen,
we marry to be called Madame, and to wear a bridal
dress and a wreath of orange flowers; we certainly
should not do this at twenty-five.</p>

<p>If the flower is not called on to form its fruit until
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"> 288</a></span>
it is fully matured, neither should man and woman:
now, in our climate the organization of neither is complete
until twenty-four or twenty-five.</p>

<p>Woman gives more to the great work of reproduction
and wears out faster in it; to render her liable to
become a mother prematurely is therefore to expose her
to greater sufferings.</p>

<p>In the first place, she is forced to share between herself
and her offspring the elements necessary to her own
nutrition, which weakens both her and the child.</p>

<p>Her development is checked, her constitution is
changed, she becomes predisposed to uterine affections,
and runs the risk of becoming an invalid at the age
when she ought to enjoy robust health.</p>

<p>The enervation of the body brings with it that of
the mind: the woman becomes nervous, irritable, and
often capricious; she cannot nurse her children; she
will not be capable of rearing them properly, she will
make dolls of them, and will favor the development of
faults which afterwards becoming vices, will afflict the
family and society.</p>

<p>This woman, a mother before her time, not only will
never become the thoughtful companion and counsellor
of her husband who, being much older than she, will
amuse himself with her as with a child, but will be his
ward for her whole life, and will have recourse to artifice
to have her own way. Thus to weaken woman in
every respect, to shorten her life, to put her under guardianship,
to prepare the way for puny and badly reared
offspring,&mdash;such are the most obvious results of her
precocious marriage.</p>

<p>To hold women in voluntary subjection and to organize
the harem among us, we need only take advantage
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"> 289</a></span>
of the permission of the law authorising their marriage
at the age of fifteen.</p>

<p>That woman may not be in subjection; that she may
be able to become a mother without detriment to her
health and under circumstances favorable to the good
organization of her children; that she may be a worthy
and earnest wife, prepared to fulfill all her duties, she
must not be married, I repeat, before twenty-four or
twenty-five; and she must not marry a man older than
herself.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> But it is claimed that the husband ought to
be ten years older than the wife, because the latter
grows old faster, and because it is necessary that the
husband should have had experience in life in order to
appreciate his wife and to render her happy.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Errors and prejudices all. Woman grows
old sooner than man only through premature marriage
and maternity; a well preserved man and woman are
alike old at the same age. But the woman consents to
grow old while the man is much less willing to do so, since
he does not blush when gray haired, to marry a young
girl, and to set up the ridiculous pretention of being
loved by her for love. Men must be broken of the
habit of believing themselves perpetually at the age
of pleasing; of imagining that they are quite as agreeable
to our eyes when they are old and ugly as if they
were Adonises. They must be told unceasingly that
what is unbecoming in us is equally so in them; and
that an old woman would be no more ridiculous in
seeking the love of a young man, than an old man in
pretending to that of a young girl.</p>

<p>The husband and wife should be nearly of the same
age; first, to treat each other more easily as equals;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"> 290</a></span>
next, because there will be more harmony in their feelings
and views, as well as in their temperaments, all
things very necessary to the organization of children.</p>

<p>It is necessary besides, in order that the woman may
not be tempted to infidelity; you know how many troubles
arise from unions disproportioned in age.</p>

<p>The husband must have <i>seen life</i>, it is said; this is
the opinion of those who permit their sons to <i>sow their
wild oats</i>; who believe that man is at liberty to wallow
in the mire of dens of infamy, and that there are two
kinds of morality. We do not belong to this class.
You would not give your daughter to a man who had
<i>seen life</i>, because he would be <i>blasé</i>, because he would
pervert her or expose her, through the disenchantment
that would follow, to seek in another what she did not
find in her husband.</p>

<p>What we have said as regards your daughter applies
also to your son; he must not marry a woman younger
than himself; for you would no more desire a disadvantageous
position for your daughter-in-law than for your
daughter; both are dear to you and worthy of respect
before the solidarity of sex.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> I shall educate my son to comprehend that
the form of marriage prescribed by the Code is merely
a relic of barbarism, that his wife owes obedience only
to Duty, that she is a free being and his equal; and
that he has no rights over her person but those which
she herself accords to him. I shall tell him that love is
a tender plant which must be tended carefully to keep it
alive; that it is blighted by unceremoniousness and
slovenliness; that he should therefore be as careful of
his personal appearance after marriage as he was to be
pleasing to the eyes of his betrothed. I shall say to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"> 291</a></span>
him: ask nothing except from the love of your wife;
remember that more than one husband has excited repulsion
by the brutality of the wedding night. Marriage,
my son, is a grave and holy thing; purity is its
choicest jewel; know that many men have owed the
adultery of their wife to the deplorable pains that they
have taken to deprave her imagination. Far from
using your influence over her who will be the half of
yourself in order to render her docile to your wishes,
and to make her your echo, develop reason and character
in her; in elevating her, you will become better,
and will prepare for yourself a counsel and stay. I
have married you under the system of separation of
goods in order that your wife may be protected against
you, should you depart from your principles; and should
you ever grieve me by straying from them, your wife
will became doubly my daughter. I shall be her companion
and consoler, and shall close my arms and my
doors on you.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Right, and you will do well to add: interest
your wife in your occupation; take care that she is
always busy, for labor is the preserver of chastity.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> To my daughter I will say: the social order
in which we live requires, my child, that you shall
superintend your house; the state of Society is still far
distant in which our sex will be relieved from this function.
Do not forget that the prosperity of the family
depends on the spirit of order and economy of the wife.
What your fortune or special business exempts you
from executing, superintend and direct. Extravagance
of dress and furniture now surpasses all bounds. Luxury
is not wrong in itself, but in the existing state of
things, it is a great relative evil, for we have not yet resolved
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"> 292</a></span>
the problem of increasing and varying products
without at the same time increasing the wretchedness
and debasement of their producers. Be simple therefore:
this does not exclude elegance, but only those
piles of silks and laces which trail in the dust of the
streets, those diamonds and precious stones which make
the fortune of the few at the expense of the morality of
the many, and which are only dead capital, the liberation
of which would be productive of great good. Do
not suffer yourself to be ensnared by the sophism that
honest women must adorn themselves to hinder men
from passing their time with courtesans. Would you
not be ashamed to compete in dress with women whom
you do not esteem, and would the man who could be
retained by such means be worth the trouble?</p>

<p>I have instructed you in your legal position as wife,
mother and property holder; I marry you under the
system of separation of goods in order to spare your
husband the temptation of regarding himself as your
master; in order that he may be obliged to take your
advice and to look upon you as his partner. Despite
these precautions, you will be a minor, since the law
thus decrees. But our law is not Reason: never forget
that you are a human being; that is, a being endowed
like your husband with intellect, sentiments, free
will, and inclination; that you owe submission only to
Reason and your conscience; that if it is your duty to
make sacrifices to the peace in little things, and to tolerate
the faults of your husband as he should tolerate
yours, it is none the less your duty resolutely to resist a
brutal&mdash;<i>I will have it so</i>.</p>

<p>You will be a mother, I hope; nurse your children
yourself, rear them in the principles of Right and Duty
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"> 293</a></span>
which I have instilled into your intellect and heart, in
order to make of them, not only just, good, chaste men
and women, but laborers in the great work of Progress.</p>

<p>You understand the great destiny of our species; you
understand your rights and duties; I need not therefore
repeat to you that woman is no more made for man
than man for woman; that consequently woman cannot,
without failing in her duty, become lost and absorbed in
man; for with him, she should love her children, her
country, humanity; she owes more to her children than
she does to him; and if forced to choose between family
interests and generous sentiments of a higher order
woman should no more hesitate than should man to
sacrifice the former to justice.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> It will be said that you instruct your
daughter in a very manly way.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> Since in our days men play the mandolin,
is it not necessary that women should speak seriously?
Since men, in the name of their naïve selfishness, claim
the right to confiscate woman to their use, to extol to
her the charms of the gyneceum, to suppress her rights,
and to preach to her the sweets of absorption, must not
women re-act against these soporific doctrines, and recall
their daughters to the sentiment of dignity and individuality.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> I endorse you with all my heart!</p>

<p>Now that we are nearly agreed on all points, we
have only to sum up what we have said, and to give an
outline of the principal reforms necessary to be wrought
in order that woman my be placed in a position more in
conformity with Right and Justice.</p>

<p class="titre">SUMMARY OF PROPOSED REFORMS.<br />
I.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Identity of right being based on identity
of species, and woman being of the same species as
man, what ought she to be before civil dignity, in the
employment of her activity and in marriage?</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> The equal of man.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> How will she become the equal of man in
civil dignity?</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> When she shall hold a place on the jury
and by the side of all civil functionaries; shall be a
member of boards of trade and mercantile associations;
and shall be a witness in all cases in which the testimony
of man is required.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Why ought the testimony of woman to be
admitted in all cases in which that of man is required?</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> Because woman is as credible as man; because
she is, like him, a civil personage.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Why ought woman to have a place on the
jury?</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> Because the Code declaring her the equal
of man as regards culpability, misdemeanor, crime and
punishment, she is thus declared capable like him of
comprehending wrong in others;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"> 295</a></span>
Because the jury being a guarantee for the male culprit,
the female culprit should have a similar guarantee;</p>

<p>Because if the <i>male</i> criminal is better comprehended
by men, the <i>female</i> criminal will be better comprehended
by women;</p>

<p>Because society in its aggregate being offended by the
crime, it is necessary that this society, composed of two
sexes, should be represented by both to judge and to
condemn it. Because, lastly, where the moral sense is
concerned, the feminine element is the more necessary inasmuch
as men claim that our sex is in general more
moral and more merciful than their own.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Why ought woman to hold a place among
civil functionaries?</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> Because society, represented by these functionaries,
is composed of two sexes;</p>

<p>Because even now in a number of public functions,
there is a department more especially belonging to woman;</p>

<p>Because, in the ceremony of the marriage celebration
for instance, if woman does not appear as magistrate,
not only is society insufficiently represented, but the
wife may regard herself as delivered up to the power of
a man by all the men of the country.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Why ought woman to have her place in
boards of trade and mercantile associations?</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> Because she shares equally in industrial
production;</p>

<p>Because she shares equally in commerce;</p>

<p>Because she understands business transactions and
contracts as well if not better than man;</p>

<p>Because, in all questions of interests, she should be
her own representative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"> 296</a></span>
<span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> When will woman become the equal of
man in the employment of her activity and of her
other faculties?</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> When she shall have colleges, academies
and schools for special instruction, and when all vocations
shall be accessible to her.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Why ought women to receive the same national
education as men?</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> Because they exercise a vast influence over
the ideas, sentiments and conduct of men, and because
it is for the interest of society that this influence should
be salutary;</p>

<p>Because it is for the interest of all to enlarge the views
and elevate the sentiments of women, in order that they
may use their natural ascendency for the advancement
of progress, of truth, of good, of moral beauty;</p>

<p>Because woman has a right, like man, to cultivate
her intellect, and to acquire the knowledge bestowed by
the state;</p>

<p>Because, lastly, as she pays her part of the expenses
of national education, it is robbery to prohibit her from
participating in it.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Why ought woman to be admitted to academies
and professional schools?</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> Because Society, not having a right to deny
the existence of any aptitude among its members, has
consequently no right to prevent those who claim to
possess them from cultivating them, nor to lock up from
them the treasures of science and practice which are at
its disposal.</p>

<p>Because there are women who are born chemists,
physicians, mathematicians, etc., and because these women
have a right to find in social institutions the same
resources as man for the cultivation of their aptitudes;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"> 297</a></span>
Because there are professions practised by women
who need the instruction that is interdicted them.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Why ought every field of occupation to be
accessible to woman?</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> Because woman is a free being, whose vocation
no one has a right to contest or to restrict;</p>

<p>Because she, no more than man, will enter vocations
forbidden her by temperament, lack of aptitude or
want of time; and it is therefore quite as unnecessary
to interdict them to her as to those men who are unfit
to enter them.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Do you not even interdict to her those vocations
in which strength is needed, or which are attended
with danger?</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> Women are not forbidden to be carpenters or
tilers, yet they do not become such, because their nature
opposes it; it is precisely because nature does oppose it,
that I think society unreasonable in meddling with the
nature. There is no need to prohibit what is impossible;
and if what has been declared impossible is done,
it is because it is possible: now society has no right to
prohibit what is possible to any of its members; this
appears even absurd where vocation is in question.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Let each one follow his private occupation
at his own risk and peril, then; but are there not certain
public functions which are not suitable for women?</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> No one knows this, since they are not open
for her admission; and, were it so, the prohibition
would be useless: competition would show the falsity
of ill-founded pretentions.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> When will woman become the equal of
man in marriage?</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> When the person of the wife is not pledged
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"> 298</a></span>
in marriage; when the engagements are reciprocal, and
when the wife is not treated as a minor and absorbed in
the husband. And this should be so:</p>

<p>Because it is not allowable to alienate one's personality,
such an alienation, being <i>immoral</i> and <i>void</i> of itself;</p>

<p>Because the wife being a distinct individual, cannot
be actually absorbed by the husband, and a law is absurd
when it rests on a fiction and supposes an impossibility;</p>

<p>Because, in fine, woman, being the equal of man before
Society, cannot, under any pretext, lose this equality
by reason of a closer association with him.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> There are two questions in marriage, aside
from that of the person&mdash;property and children. Do
you not think that the married woman ought, like the
unmarried woman who has attained majority, to be mistress
of her property, to be free to exercise any profession
that suits her, and to be at liberty to sell, to buy,
to give, to receive, and to institute suits at law?</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> The married man having all these rights,
it is evident that the married woman ought to have
them under the law of equality. Are you not of the
same opinion?</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> In all partnerships, we pledge a portion of
our liberty on certain points agreed upon. Now the
husband and wife are partners; they cannot therefore
be as perfectly free with respect to each other as though
they were strangers; but it is necessary, we repeat,
that their position should be the same and their pledges
mutual. If the wife can neither sell, nor alienate, nor
give, nor receive, nor appear in court without the consent
of the husband, it is not allowable for the husband
to do these things without the consent of the wife; if
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"> 299</a></span>
the wife is not permitted to practise a profession without
the consent of the husband, the husband is not at liberty
to do so without the consent of the wife; if the wife cannot
pledge the common property without authority from
the husband, the husband cannot pledge it without the
consent of the wife. I go further; I would not willingly
permit the wife, before the age of twenty-five, to give
her husband authority to alienate anything belonging to
one of the two; the husband has too much influence
over her for her to be really free before this age.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> But what if one of the parties through caprice
or evil motives is unwilling that the other should
do something that is proper and advantageous?</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Arbiters are frequently chosen in the differences
that arise between partners in business; society,
represented by the judicial power, is the general arbiter
between the husband and wife; still we think that
it would be well to establish between them a perpetual
arbiter, holding the first degree of jurisdiction: this
might be the family council, organized differently from
the present. Before this confidential tribunal, better
fitted than any other to understand the case, the husband
and wife should carry, not only the differences
arising between them concerning questions of interests,
but those relating to the education, profession and marriage
of the children. This tribunal should give the
first judgment, and much scandal would be avoided by
its decisions, from which besides one could always appeal
to the social court.</p>

<p>I need not add that the right of the father and the
mother over the children is absolutely equal, and that, if
the right of either could be contested, it would not be
that of the mother, who alone can say, I <i>know</i>, I am
<i>certain</i> that these children are mine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"> 300</a></span>
<span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> In fact, it is odious that the plenitude of
right should be found on the side of the mere legal
presumption, the act of faith, uncertainty.</p>

<p>Regarding marriage as a partnership of equals, do
you not think that it would be well to mark this equality
and the distinction of personalities in the name borne
by the spouses and their children?</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Certainly, on the day of marriage each of
the spouses should join his partner's name to his own;
this is done already in certain cantons of Switzerland,
and even in France, among a few individuals.</p>

<p>The children should bear the double name of their
parents until marriage, when the daughters should
keep the mother's name, and the sons the father's; or
else, if we wish to bring into the question the system
of liberty, it might be decreed that, on attaining majority,
the child himself should choose which of the two
names he would bear and transmit.</p>

<p class="subh">II.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> Now, let us take up the political right.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> A nation is an association of free and equal
individuals, co-operating, by their labor and contributions,
to the maintenance of the common work; they have
an incontestible right to do whatever is necessary to protect
their persons, their rights and their property from
injury. Man has political rights because he is free and
the equal of his co-partners; according to others, because
he is a producer and a tax-payer; now, woman
being, through identity of species, free and the equal of
man; being in point of fact, a producer and a tax-payer;
and having the same general instincts as man,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"> 301</a></span>
it is evident that she has the same political rights as he.
Such are the principles, let us proceed to the application.</p>

<p>We have said elsewhere, that it is not enough that a
thing should be true in an absolute sense; it is necessary
under penalty of transforming good into evil, to take
into account the surroundings into which we seek to introduce
it; this men too often forget, the <i>practical</i> truth
in our question is that it is profitable to recognize political
rights <i>only to the extent to which it is demanded</i>, because
those who do not demand it are intellectually incapable
of making use of it, and because if they should
exercise it, in a majority of cases, it would be against
their own interests; Prudence exacts that we should
be sure that the possessor of a right is really emancipated,
and that he will not be the blind tool of a man or
a party.</p>

<p>Now, in the existing state of affairs, women not only
do not demand their political rights, but laugh at those
who address them on the subject; they pride themselves
on being thought unfit for that which regards
general interests; they recognize themselves therefore
as incapable.</p>

<p>On the other hand, they are minors civilly, slaves of
prejudice, deprived of general education, submissive for
the most part to the influence of their husbands, lovers
or confessors, clinging as a majority to the ways of the
past. If therefore they should enter without preparation
into political life, they would either duplicate
men or cause humanity to retrograde.</p>

<p>You comprehend now why many women who are
more capable than an infinite number of men of coöperating
in great political acts, choose rather to renounce
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"> 302</a></span>
them than to compromise the cause of progress by the
extension of political right to all women.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> Personally, I am of your opinion; but it is
necessary to foresee and to refute the objections that
may be made to you by very intelligent women; these
women will say, Reflect, the negation of right is iniquitous,
for it is the negation of equality and of human
nature. It is as false as dangerous to lay down the
principle of the recognition of right only to the extent
in which it is claimed; for it is notorious that slaves are
not the ones in general to demand their own rights;
your affirmation therefore condemns the emancipation
of slaves and serfs, and universal suffrage.</p>

<p>The objection that you raise against the right on account
of the incapacity of women and the low use
which they would make of it, might apply quite as well
to men who are scarcely more fully emancipated than
they; who are often the duplicate of their wife or confessor,
or who have no other opinion than that of their
electoral committee.</p>

<p>In right, as in everything else, an apprenticeship is
necessary: woman will make use of it at first badly,
then better, then well; for we learn to play on an instrument
much more quickly by using it than by learning
its theory.</p>

<p>The exercise of right gives elevation and dignity,
elevates the individual in his own esteem, and causes
him to study questions which he would have neglected
had he not been obliged to examine them in order to
concur in and resolve them. Do you wish women to
take to heart matters of general interest? Then give
them political right.</p>

<p>These objections, may be raised against you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"> 303</a></span>
<span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> They were raised against me in 1848 by a
number of eminent women, and by many men devoted
to the triumph of the new principles.</p>

<p>I answered them then and I answer them again to-day:
We should speedily agree, if our modern society
were not the scene of conflict between two diametrically
opposite principles.</p>

<p>The question is not to decide whether political right
belongs to woman, whether she would develop it, enlarge
it, etc., but rather whether she would use it to ensure
the triumph of the principle that says to humanity,
Advance! or of that which gives as the word of command,
Retreat!</p>

<p>What is the end of political right? Evidently, to
accomplish a great duty in the direction of progress.
Well, is it not dangerous to accord it to those who would
employ it against this end?</p>

<p>What! you struggle for right, in order to obtain the
triumph of a holy cause, yet feel no hesitation in according
it to those who would certainly make use of
right to kill right!</p>

<p>You reproach me for acting like the Jesuits, who
value justice much less than expediency. Well, gentlemen,
if you had had half their ability, you would have
been successful long ago. Like true savages, you
would think yourselves dishonored by possessing prudence
and practical sense, by offering yourselves to battle
otherwise than with naked bodies; this may be very
fine, very courageous&mdash;but as to being sensible, that is
another thing.</p>

<p>I am not guilty of the crime of denying right, since
I do not deny it; I only desire that it shall not be demanded
since this would be suicidal, I do not lay down
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"> 304</a></span>
the principle that <i>every kind</i> of right should be recognized
only to the extent in which it is claimed, since I
speak to you of political rights alone; there are rights
which make their own demand, such as those of living,
of development, of enjoyment, of the fruit of one's labor,
and it is shameful for society not to recognize them
to their full extent. But we awaken later to the sentiment
of civil right, and still later to that of political
right; take the logical advance of humanity into account
therefore and do not remain in the absolute.</p>

<p>I know that my objection on the score of the incapacity
of women is quite as applicable to that of men;
but is it a reason, because you have admitted the right
of the ignorant masses of men who had not demanded
it, to show yourselves equally unwise with respect to
women who are in the same position? I will correct
myself, gentlemen, of what you term my <i>aristocratic</i>
spirit, when I see your political freedmen comprehending
the tendencies of civilization, and making use of
their right to drive the abettors of the past to despair
by promoting the triumph of liberty and equality. Until
then, permit me to keep my opinion.</p>

<p>And I have kept my opinion, which is this: the exercise
of political right is a means of reform and progress,
only if those who enjoy it believe in progress and are
anxious for reforms: in the opposite case, the popular
vote can be nothing but the expression of prejudices,
errors and passions&mdash;instead of learning to exercise it
through the use of it, as it is urged, they employ it
simply to cut their own fingers.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> May it not be objected that, in accordance
with your theory of right, all being equal, no one can
arrogate to himself the function of distributing rights?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"> 305</a></span>
<span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Theory is the ideal towards which practice
should tend; if we had not this ideal, we could not
know by what principle to guide ourselves; but in
social <i>reality</i>, there are individuals who have attained
majority, and others who, being minors, are destined to
attain it.</p>

<p>If I should assert that those who have attained majority
can rightfully accord or refuse right to the minors,
I should depart essentially from my principles; it
is by the <i>law</i>, which is the expression of the conscience
of those most advanced, while waiting till it shall be the
conscience of all, that political majority is decreed and
that its conditions are established. The right is virtual
in each of us; no one therefore has the right to give it,
to take it away, or to contest it; it is recognized when
we are in a condition to exercise and to demand it;
and we prove that we are in a condition to exercise it
when we satisfy the conditions fixed by the law.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> What should be these conditions for the
enjoyment of political right, in your opinion?</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Twenty-five years of age; and a certificate
attesting that the individual knows how to read, write
and reckon, that he possesses an elementary knowledge
of the history and geography of his country; together
with a correct theory with respect to Right and Duty,
and the destiny of humanity upon earth. The knowledge
of a small volume would be sufficient, as you see,
to enable every man and woman, twenty-five years of
age and healthy in mind, to enjoy political rights, after
having been subjected to an initiation by the enjoyment
of civil rights. But, I ask you, what could those
do with political right who confound liberty with license,
who scarcely know the meaning of the words
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"> 306</a></span>
Right and Duty, and who are even incapable of writing
their own vote! Men have their rights, let them
keep them! a right once admitted cannot be taken
away: let them render themselves fit to exercise them.
As to women, let them first emancipate themselves civilly
and become educated: their turn will come.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> It is very important that men should comprehend
that you do not deny, but merely postpone the
political rights of our sex.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Be easy; they will comprehend it rightly;
they will not mistake counsel dictated by prudence for
an acknowledgement of inferiority and a resignation of
functions.</p>

<p class="subh">III.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> Will you now state the legal reforms which
we should demand successively.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> So far as civil life is concerned, we should
ask:</p>

<p>That a woman who is a foreigner may be able to become
naturalized in a country otherwise than by marriage.</p>

<p>That woman shall not lose her nationality by the
same sacrament.</p>

<p>That woman be admitted to sign, as a witness, all certificates
of social condition, with all others that have
been hitherto interdicted to her.</p>

<p>You know that already, in derogation of the law,
midwives sign certificates of birth of unacknowledged
natural children, and that, in certain notarial documents,
drawn up by justices of the peace, to attest to a fact in
the absence of written evidence, the testimony of women
is admitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"> 307</a></span>
We demand that tradeswomen and merchant women
shall form a part of the boards of trade; that in every
criminal trial, women shall be placed on the jury: that
to women shall be entrusted the management and superintendence
of hospitals, prisons for women, and charitable
associations.</p>

<p>That in every district, a woman shall be appointed to
superintend girls' schools, infant asylums, and nurses.</p>

<p>You know that women are already filling public
employments in derogation of the law, since the teaching
and inspection of girls' schools, and other asylums,
are entrusted to them, and since women keep post-offices,
stamp offices, etc.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> This regards civil Right in general; what
reforms shall we demand concerning married women?</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> That the conjugal abode shall be that
which is inhabited by the husband and wife <i>together</i>,
no longer by the man alone.</p>

<p>That the articles shall be suppressed which command
the wife to obey her husband, and to follow him wherever
he sees fit to reside.</p>

<p>That the prohibition to sell, mortgage, receive, give,
appear in law, etc., without the consent of the husband
or court, shall be extended to the husband as far as to
the wife.</p>

<p>That marriage under the system of separation of
goods shall become the public law.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> What reforms do you demand with respect
to the family council and guardianship?</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> We demand that the family council shall
be composed of twenty persons; ten men and ten women,
parents, relatives and friends, chosen by the
spouses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"> 308</a></span>
That the powers of this council, presided over by the
justice of the peace, shall be so determined that it shall
give the first judgment in differences arising between
the spouses as to children, property, guardianship, etc.</p>

<p>We demand that every woman may be qualified to
be appointed guardian or to watch over the conduct of
the guardian towards the ward.</p>

<p>That the guardianship of the spouse interdicted shall
be always confessed by the family council.</p>

<p>That the wife like the husband, may name a definitive
guardian and a council of guardianship for her surviving
spouse.</p>

<p>That the spouses may name during their lifetime, the
father, a male inspecting guardian from his family, the
mother, a female inspecting guardian from hers, that in
case of pre-decease, the children may be always under
the influence of both sexes.</p>

<p>That this superior guardianship, in the absence of any
expressed desire, belongs of right to a member of the
family of the defunct, who must be of the same sex.</p>

<p>That in case of a second marriage, if the child is
maltreated or unhappy, the inspecting guardian, whether
male or female, can have it adjudged to him by the
family council, without excluding the appeal of the
guardian to the courts.</p>

<p>That in case of the death of the father or mother,
the guardianship belongs of right to the nearest ancestor,
and the inspecting guardianship to the nearest ancestor
of the other line.</p>

<p>If there be competition between the two lines, the
family councils shall choose the guardian from one family
and the inspecting guardian from the other, and of
opposite sex.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"> 309</a></span>
That the duties of guardianship and inspecting guardianship
shall comprehend, not only the material, but
also the moral and intellectual interests of the wards.</p>

<p>That the father who is guardian, shall lose the right of
guardianship over the children if he re-marries without
first having had it continued to him by the family council.</p>

<p>That lastly, the State shall so organize a board of
guardianship for abandoned children that the boys shall
be under the superintendence of the men and the girls
under that of the women; this board will form a great
family council.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> I like your system better than that of the
law, not only because woman is the equal of man therein,
but because wards will be better protected by it; I
have known men to cause their wives, over-excited by
their ill treatment, to be placed under interdict, in order
to remain masters of their property; on the other hand,
you know how many children are wronged or made unhappy
by the second marriage of their father. A step-mother
has full power to inflict suffering on the little
unfortunates.</p>

<p>But you have said nothing of the authority of parents
over their children.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> The authority of the parents over the children
is the same; the expression, paternal authority, is
incomplete; the true phrase would be <i>parental</i> authority.
On this head, we demand that if there be dissension
between the father and mother with regard to the
children, the family council shall decide in the first instance.</p>

<p>That neither the father nor the mother shall have
power to shut up the child unless <i>both are agreed</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"> 310</a></span>
That the father or the mother acting as guardian
shall not have power to have recourse to this measure
except with the concurrence of the inspecting guardian,
or, in case of difference, with the approbation of the
family council, always reserving the right of appeal to
the court.</p>

<p>That the marriageable age shall be fixed at twenty-five
for both sexes.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> Shall we demand the suppression of separation
from bed and board?</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> No; but we must demand that <i>divorce
shall be established</i>.</p>

<p>That divorce may be obtained for the adultery of one
of the parties, cruelty, grave abuses, condemnation to
punishment affecting the liberty or person, notorious
vices, incompatibility of temper, mutual consent.</p>

<p>That, during the suit for separation or for divorce,
the guardianship of the children shall be given to the
most deserving parent; and that, if both are alike unworthy,
a guardian and inspecting guardian of different
sexes shall be appointed.</p>

<p>That, if both are deserving, they shall settle it amicably
between themselves before the family council.</p>

<p>That parties married under the dotal system or under
that of the separation of goods, shall have control of
their own property.</p>

<p>That if the petition for divorce be on account of the
bad management of the common property, the administration
shall be taken away from the husband and entrusted
to the wife.</p>

<p>That if the petition be on account of the condemnation
of one of the parties to punishment affecting the
liberty or person, the other shall remain administrator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"> 311</a></span>
That, in all other cases, an inventory shall be made
and the spouse best fitted to the task be appointed
guardian under the surveillance of one or two members
of the family of the other spouse, with the obligation of
furnishing estovers to the other.</p>

<p>That the decree granting the divorce or separation
shall bear the number, name and age of the children
born of the marriage, together with the annual sum
that each party is bound to furnish for their maintenance
and education.</p>

<p>That this decree shall state to whose custody the children
are entrusted, whether by natural consent or by
familial or judicial authority.</p>

<p>That it shall be placarded publicly in the courts, and
inserted in the leading journals of the vicinity.</p>

<p>That this instrument shall accompany the publication
of the bans of a subsequent marriage, under pain of
heavy penalties.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> These measures are severe; if it would be
easy to become divorced, it would not be easy to marry
afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> I do not deny it; but it is better to prevent
divorce by the difficulty of marrying afterwards, than
by placing restrictions upon it; in the first case, the
difficulty comes from the fetters which the individual
has forged for himself; he makes his own destiny; in
the second, individual liberty is infringed upon by social
authority, which is an abuse of power.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> Let us enter upon the legal reforms concerning
morals.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> We demand that every promise of marriage
which is not fulfilled shall be punished with a fine
and damages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"> 312</a></span>
That every man whom an unmarried mother can
prove by witnesses or letters, to be the father of her
child, shall be subject to the burdens of paternity.</p>

<p>That the investigation of paternity shall be authorized
like that of maternity.</p>

<p>That the seduction of an unmarried woman under
twenty-five shall be severely punished.</p>

<p>That no unmarried woman can be registered among
the public women before twenty-five years old, and that
she shall be put into the house of correction if she
abandons herself to prostitution before this age.</p>

<p>That every abandoned woman who receives a man
under twenty-five years of age shall be punished with
fine and imprisonment, and that the penalty shall be
terrible if she is diseased.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> It will be said that paternity cannot be
proved.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> I do not deny that it may be possible that
the father attributed to the natural child will not be the
true one; but it will be necessary to establish by proofs
that he has rendered himself liable to be reputed such:
it is the probability of paternity in marriage extended
to paternity out of marriage. So much the worse for
men who suffer themselves to be caught! it is shameful
to attach impunity to the most disorderly and subversive
of selfish desires; women must no longer bear alone
the burden of natural children, and no longer be tempted
to abandon them.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> But what if it be proved that a married
man has rendered himself liable to become a father outside
his household.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> This should be first a case of divorce;
next, of punishment for him and his accomplice. As
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"> 313</a></span>
to the child, the man should bear the charge of it in
concert with the mother.</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> These are indeed Draconian laws!</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Do you not see that corruption is shutting
us in, body and soul; and that if we do not create a vigorous
reaction against it by the severity of the laws,
the reform of education, and the awakening of the ideal,
our society will be, ere long, only an immense brothel?</p>

<p><span class="cap">R</span><span class="smallc">EADER.</span> Alas! it is but too true.</p>

<p><span class="cap">A</span><span class="smallc">UTHOR.</span> Let us demand then, not only a rational reform
of the national education, but also that the number
of lyceums shall be doubled for girls.</p>

<p>That all the institutions of higher instruction dependent
on the state shall be open to them as to boys.</p>

<p>That they shall be admitted to receive the same university
degrees, and the same diplomas of capacity as
men.</p>

<p>That every field of occupation shall be opened to
them as to men;</p>

<p>So that, elevated in public opinion by equality, their
activity shall no longer be nominally compensated; that
they may live by their labor, and that want, discouragement
and suicide may no longer terminate their life
when they do not make choice of the sad part of elements
of demoralization.</p>

<p class="titre">I.<br />
<span class="medium">APPEAL TO WOMEN.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Progressive women, to you, I address my last words,
Listen in the name of the general good, in the name of
your sons and your daughters.</p>

<p>You say: the manners of our time are corrupt; the
laws concerning our sex need reform.</p>

<p>It is true; but do you think that to verify the evil
suffices to cure it?</p>

<p>You say: so long as woman shall be a minor in the
city, the state and marriage, she will be so in social labor;
she will be forced to be supported by man; that is
to debase him while humbling herself.</p>

<p>It is true; but do you believe that to verify these
things suffices to remedy our abasement?</p>

<p>You say: the education that both sexes receive is deplorable
in view of the destiny of humanity.</p>

<p>It is true; but do you believe that to affirm this suffices
to improve, to transform the method of education?</p>

<p>Will words, complaints and protestations have power
to change any of these things?</p>

<p>It is not to lament over them that is needed; it is to
act.</p>

<p>It is not merely to demand justice and reform that is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"> 315</a></span>
needed; it is to labor ourselves for reform; it is to prove
<i>by our works</i> that we are worthy to obtain justice; it is
to take possession resolutely of the contested place; it
is, in a word, to have intellect, courage and activity.</p>

<p>Upon whom then will you have a right to count, if
you abandon yourselves?</p>

<p>Upon men? Your carelessness and silence have in
part discouraged those who maintained your right; it
is much if they defend you against those who, to oppress
you, call to their aid every species of ignorance, every
species of despotism, every selfish passion, all the paradoxes
which they despise when their own sex is in question.</p>

<p>You are insulted, you are outraged, you are denied
or you are blamed in order that you may be reduced to
subjection, and it is much if your indignation is roused
thereby!</p>

<p>When will you be ashamed of the part to which you
are condemned?</p>

<p>When will you respond to the appeal that generous
and intelligent men have made to you?</p>

<p>When will you cease to be masculine photographs,
and resolve to complete the revolution of humanity by
finally making the word of woman heard in Religion,
in Justice, in Politics and in Science?</p>

<p>What are we to do, you say?</p>

<p>What are you to do, ladies? Well! what is done by
women believing. Look at those who have given their
soul to a dogma; they form organizations, teach, write,
act on their surroundings and on the rising generation
in order to secure the triumph of the faith that has the
support of their conscience. Why do not you do as
much as they?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"> 316</a></span>
Your rivals write books stamped with supernaturalism
and individualistic morality, why do you not write
those that bear the stamp of rationalism, of solidary
morality and of a holy faith in Progress?</p>

<p>Your rivals found educational institutions and train
up professors in order to gain over the new generation
to their dogmas and their practices, why do not you do
as much for the benefit of the new ideas?</p>

<p>Your rivals organize industrial associations, why do
not you imitate them?</p>

<p>Would not what is lawful to them be so to you.</p>

<p>Could a government which professes to revive the
principles of '89, and which is the offspring of Revolutionary
right, entertain the thought of fettering the direct
heirs of the principles laid down by '89, while
leaving those free to act who are more or less their enemies?
Can any one of you admit such a possibility?</p>

<p>What are we to do?</p>

<p>You are to establish a journal to maintain your claims.</p>

<p>You are to appoint an encyclopedic committee to
draw up a series of treatises on the principal branches of
human knowledge for the enlightenment of women and
the people.</p>

<p>You are to found a Polytechnic Institute for women.</p>

<p>You are to aid your sisters of the laboring classes to
organize themselves in trades associations on economical
principles more equitable than those of the present time.</p>

<p>You are to facilitate the return to virtue of the lost
women who ask you for aid and counsel.</p>

<p>You are to labor with all your might for the reform of
educational methods.</p>

<p>Yet, in the face of a task so complicated, you ask:
what are we to do?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"> 317</a></span>
Ah, ye women who have attained majority, arise, if
ye have heart and courage!</p>

<p>Arise, and let those among you who are the most intelligent,
the most instructed, and who have the most
time and liberty constitute an <i>Apostleship of women</i>.</p>

<p>Around this Apostleship, let all the women of Progress
be ranged, that each one may serve the common
cause according to her means.</p>

<p>And remember, remember above all things, that <i>Union
is strength</i>.</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
